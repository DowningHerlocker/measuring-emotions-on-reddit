Hear me out. \n\nThere are several neighborhoods outside of Center City and South Philly that might work, but the one I'm familiar with is West Philly. I have a car and don't have trouble finding parking despite not having a neighborhood parking sticker and have to rely on the free/untimed spots. If you weren't a cheapskate like me and got a sticker, you could park within half a block of whatever house or store you wanted to. The major grocery stores, CVS, and the liquor store (all the necessities, lol) all have free parking lots. Trader Joe's and Whole Foods on Callowhill are a close drive and have parking lots too, though sometimes it takes a few minutes queuing to get a spot. If you drive 10-15 minutes across Gray's Ferry, there are a huge number of suburban-esque shopping centers with ample parking that include supermarkets, home improvement stores, movie theaters, Ikea, etc. The Upper Darby H-Mart has parking and is a 10 minute drive. You could live like a king here for 2K a month, also, and I wouldn't be surprised if you could find a place with a dedicated parking spot for that amount. If you're up for public transit occasionally, the buses and trolleys stop every block or so and are convenient to Center City and Old City and their bars and restaurants. The transit is accessible if you ever find yourself wanting to get around in a chair.\n\nThree caveats for West Philly. One, don't bring a new car like I unfortunately did, since insurance is more expensive in the city and street parking equals bumper dings and the occasional knocked mirror. Two, the area north of Baltimore Avenue has some ups-and-downs. Nothing like Mt. Airy, but there are one or two hills to contend with. Three, you'd probably need a ground floor apartment if you live in one of the Victorian rowhomes or you'd need to limit your search to the larger apartment complexes which have elevators.\n\nHave you looked into handicap placards and that kind of thing? If your injury is really impeding your walking ability, you should check out if you qualify. That would really, really open up the city to you, I think, since Philly has a lot of accessible parking spots and you can even get a dedicated spot in front of your house.\n\nTo actually recommend a suburb for you, Collingswood is pretty cool.

I don't have kids and I work 9-5 and still love it here (I have also written up my love for manayunk in other posts - see my post history).\n\nWITH THAT BEING SAID:\n\nI would also highly recommend conshy - it is not as suburb-y as it seems it's very walkable and right on the norristown line, it has a HUGE population of 20-30 year olds and a very active social night life scene, i actually run with the conshy runners and would consider moving there if I ever needed to.. (I guess if I worked in the suburbs?) But I work in CC and take the express bus to work for 78$/month (tokens) and a 20 minute ride.\n\nI would honestly avoid east falls - while it is closer to the city there isnt a lot of nightlife (i think like.. 5-9 restuarants... total?) and it's still pretty far from the city - there is a train station which is about a 20 minute train ride, but it's septa so it's always late and inconvenient times. OR the bus which isn't express and goes through some dicey neighborhoods.\n\nfeel free to pm me with any questions - or if you want to grab a drink and check out the 'hood!","score":16}],"sum":102,"min":-4,"max":25},{"title":"List of free outdoor movie screenings this Summer","url":"http://www.thrillist.com/events/philadelphia/philadelphia-outdoor-movie-calendar-2015-free-summer-film-screenings","permalink":"/r/philadelphia/comments/39x39k/list_of_free_outdoor_movie_screenings_this_summer/","score":37,"numComments":2,"subreddit":"philadelphia","comments":[{"text":"These are not all free.

Its a very casual 9 hole, no worry about dress code or uppity golfers.  ","score":-4},{"text":"Ahwatukee Country Club.  My wife bought me the Gold Card last year since we live in the neighborhood.  I'm thinking about getting the Practice Plus program this year: http://www.ahwatukeegolf.com/membership-golf-passes/practice-plus  since it's good for people like me that don't get to play much but like to go hit a bucket every now and then.\n\nHaven't  really had time to play much but if you get there at the right time, you can play slow and just let others play through.  There are times when the place is pretty booked up and you will need to get a tee time.  I try and get the first tee off of the day so I don't have to deal with the heat too bad.  I guess you could get the last tee time so you wouldn't have to worry about someone waiting on you trying to play through.\n\nOne thing about Ahwatukee.  If you can't hit straight, it is easy to have your ball hit one of the houses.  The fairways are pretty narrow and make me nervous since I am not too good and not consistent with my drives.  Check out the lanes on Google maps so you can see what I'm talking about.  You probably don't have that problem though.\n\nMost of the courses around here have a dress code, but it is the usual that you would expect at most municipal courses.  From their webpage: \"Shirts with collar, tailored mid-length shorts, skirts or pants.  Ahwatukee Country Club is a soft spike facility\"  In other words, collar, no cut-offs, no hard spikes.  Pretty easy dress code.\n\nAhwatukee is part of the Foothills Golf Properties.  There are 4 courses included in the group.  Ahwatukee, Duke, Foothills, &amp; Club West.  Here is their site with all the info: http://www.ahwatukeegolf.com/\n\nThey have links to the other 3 member courses at the bottom of the homepage.\n\nThe front and back nine are clearly separated with the front nine on the west side of 48th street and the back nine on the east side of 48th street.  I haven't even played the back  nine yet but only because I don't have the time.  \n\nThe guy that runs the pro shop is really friendly.  I haven't been there in a while so I don't know if that is changed or if someone else is running the shop now or not.  One thing about the gold card and probably the other new card is that $100 of your membership goes on a store card that you can use in the shop, at the dining/food bar, or other club purchases.  So even if you don't get to play much, you can still go in and have some decent food.\n\ntl;dr - Ahwatukee Country Club - The good:  decent prices, friendly pro shop, some cool discount club cards, simple dress code, open to the public.  The bad: sometimes busy, narrow fairways.","score":9},{"text":"Encanto 9 is cool. Very relaxed, I think the current rate is under $10 for walking. Its on encanto and 19th ave.

Are you sure that you are comfortable moving away from OSX?  Since your professional experience revolved around it, I would assume that you are accustomed to the way a Mac functions.  Additionally, I know that there are a lot of Mac-specific applications (expecially in the creative arts industries) that are simply unavailable on a Windows/Linux OS.  There are ways to install OSX on a self-built PC, but it isn't easy and will usually cause incompatibilities.  (don't get me started on doing OSX Upgrades)\n2. Everyone else is correct.  Buying the correct parts and putting them in the correct place without frying something is actually relatively easy.  There are actually physical limitations to physically prevent you from plugging something in wrong.  Putting it together is not the hard part.  Configuring it correctly is the hard part.  In graphic design, there are \"Certified\" components and \"Certified\" driver configurations.  This may or may not be important to you, but just keep in mind that you can't always just go buy a graphics card and it will be guaranteed to work.\n3. What is your backup plan if something broke?  Do you have a spare desktop that will get you by well enough to keep you going?  how long do you have to figure out why your unsupported graphics card is throwing rendering errors and artifacts?  How long can you be down before you need to be up and running again?  There are reasons why corporations pay $5000 for a $2000 computer.  That additional $3000 gives them 3 years of 4-hour response times in case something breaks.\n\nThat being said, if you want someone who has a lot of experience building, buying, and repairing servers and workstation-class hardware, feel free to reach out to me.

That, of course, is the opposite of most traffic patterns in Oakland County.\n\n-The Southfield is busy in both directions during rush hour, but it is generally busier towards Dearborn in the morning and towards Southfield/Oakland County in the evening. \n\n-75 south of 696 is a mess at rush hour going downtown in the morning and coming out of the city in the evening. Reverse commuting on that stretch is usually pretty easy, except on evenings when the Tigers are at home. North of 696, it's usually packed in both directions at both rush hours to 14 Mile or even Big Beaver. North of there, it's quieter until about Square Lake, then really rough from Square Lake to M-24 (especially northbound in the evening and southbound in the morning). \n\n-The stretch of Woodward from 13 Mile to McNichols is usually dense with inbound traffic in the morning and outbound traffic in the evening, but it rarely backs up or slows down. Below McNichols, where it narrows, it can sometimes get congested, but it's really not that bad compared to I-75. Right now, there is construction through Midtown, but if you jump over to Cass or John R or Second you can get downtown without crawling through the construction zone. \n\nHope this helps!","score":6},{"text":"I live in downtown Royal Oak, and it can't be beat in terms of access to both I-75 and I-696.

Something like Troy or Madison heights is great because it hedges right on the freeway and you can avoid the annoying stop and go local traffic for the most part.

I don't remember a lot of their conversation. But this sort of thing happens a lot. Especially to house flippers here in Seattle. They'll buy a foreclosed/abandoned house and try to flip it and find out there are thousands in overdue bills that the flippers are on the hook for *even though* they're brand new to the property.

And it was mentioned that the elderly often get into this situation] ","score":0},{"text":"Something's not adding up here and not on your behalf.  If SPU had a lien on the house, it would have been paid for by the seller assuming there was money left over after all other lien holders (banks who lent money) were paid off.\n\nI'm not entirely sure, but I believe this is what title insurance is purchased for.

It's entirely likely that the flippers who bought the property never switched the utilities into their own name. As a result, charges would have accumulated under the previous owner's name, and it wouldn't be an issue for them as long as they kept the charges low enough that the property was not subject to a disconnection at the time that the sale was made. Of course, now that you own the property, it's your problem.\n\nAnd let's be clear: SPU doesn't care. They get paid because -- sooner or later -- an owner will come around who will need their water turned on and (especially if the water is disconnected) will be forced to pay the past due amounts (regardless of whether they actually used the water themselves). For SPU, it's a waiting game. Sooner or later, they will get paid ... and they don't care who pays, as long as the bill is paid.\n\nMy advice? You will likely want to look up who owned the property previous to you on King County Parcel Viewer. If there was an owner between you and the owner whose name is on the bill, I'd bet good money that is the entity that used the water. Note that you will still likely have to pay the bill (because the bill is attached to the house as a lien), but you can sue the previous owner(s) in small claims court to recover your costs. \n\nAnd, as always, it's a good idea to talk with a lawyer anyway to see what their opinion on the matter is.\n\nGood luck!","score":7},{"text":"This was a failure by your escrow company, follow up with your agent and make sure they sent the request.\n\nI had to do it for water/sewer, electric, and gas services and it was all taken care of by the seller when it popped. up.","score":0},{"text":"This happened to me.

I'm looking for a studio/1 bedroom apartment, and from what I've seen on craigslist/Trulia/Apartments.com/etc rents in Denver tend be cheaper than rents in the northwest suburbs (Louisville/Superior/Broomfield) or Boulder. I'll be taking out loans to pay for school and living expenses, so finding a cheap place is important and I'm willing to sacrifice square footage/\"niceness\" for cheaper rent and utilities.

I do have a car that I'll be bringing with me, but I'm concerned about the commute to Boulder. Google maps says it roughly 45 minutes one-way. Is this still accurate considering I'll usually be driving there and back during rush hour? Also, my route to Boulder would mostly be three roads - west on Colfax, north on I-25/HWY-87, and northwest on HWY-36/Denver-Boulder Turnpike. How are these roads in the snow? Do they usually get plowed quickly? I used to live in Minneapolis so I am definitely used to winter driving, but I'm concerned that snow/ice could prevent me from getting up to Boulder during the winter. Overall, is living in Capitol Hill and commuting to Boulder a feasible plan?\n\n2. I am a fairly quiet person. I need something close to silence to be able to study/read (which I will be doing a lot as a law student) and sleep. Will noise be a significant factor in the Capitol Hill area? Does it get noticeably noisier the closer one gets to Colfax? Do renters in the area tend to be loud or quiet? Any insight on this would be much appreciated.\n\nLastly, I am a marijuana user and would like to be able to smoke in my apartment on occasion. I am very familiar with CO's marijuana laws and have read the \"Marijuana FAQ\" on this subreddit.

Obviously rational decision making says that if it's legal in CO, it should not be legal to terminate for using marijauna. Because we're still in this weird federally unenforced limbo, it's not surprising that Colorado is leery of making it illegal for out-of-state companies to terminate employees who violate federal law, even if the law is unenforced.\n\nGiven that we're not far from federal reclassification of pot, it's a ruling with limited (but punishing for those affected) effect.","score":-7},{"text":"At the risk of going against the popular opinion here, I have to say that this ruling makes sense.  Keep in mind, I don't like it, but understand why they ruled in this manner.  \n\nA bit if history first.  Over the course of the 20th century, the power, definition and scope of the [Commerce Clause](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commerce_Clause) was expanded greatly.  Per modern interpretations of the clause, the federal government has total power over all commerce, even if a company operates and only sells their goods in a single state.  As a result, every business is subject to federal guidelines.  \n\nThen you have the [Supremacy Clause](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supremacy_Clause) which states that the US Constitution and federal statues are the supreme law of the land.  This is overall a good thing because it prevents states from enacting laws that infringe on the rights of others (examples: interracial marriage and soon to be gay marriage).  \n\nSo now with legalized marijuana you have conflicting laws.  One states that it is A-OK and the other states that it could possibly bring the apocalypse upon us.  Unfortunately, the one that states that marijuana is illegal is the federal laws and regulations.  Thus it wins.  Right now, the federal government is will within its right to swoop down upon Colorado, arrest every marijuana grower and confiscate all the property.  So far, they haven't done that at the direction of the White House.  (This policy can easily be changed with the next President.  Voting is important people!)  \n\nIf state and federal law conflict, the business must follow the federal law.  It's just how our country works.  \n\nTo give you a real life example, I used to manage local-route truckers.  Even though we only delivered within the state of Colorado, we were still subject to USDOT rules.  US DOT states that anyone with a CDL can be randomly drug tested and if you pop positive, bad shit happens.  Say the CO Supreme Court ruled the opposite way in this case and a local truck driver pops positive and gets fired.  The driver sues for wrongful termination because CO says its okay, but the feds say it isn't.  It ends up in another huge legal battle that would reach federal courts and could possibly even end worse for the state of Colorado.  \n\nPersonally, I am against all drug/alcohol testing within a workplace unless the employee is clearly working under the influence or a workplace accident/injury occurs.  The employer has no business dictating what an employee does during their off time.  Unfortunately, current law and court rulings say otherwise and that is why we are in this situation in the first place. \n\nSo, for the time being, we have to deal with this ruling.  Things will only change when the federal government classifies marijuana on the same level as alcohol and tobacco, or at the very least removes it from a schedule 1 substance.

He marks his keys so when one comes back for another copy he will know to compensate for the extra depth.

The best advice I ever received was to interview the management companies. It sounded like an inconvenience, and it was, but meeting one or two of the people that would potentially be looking over my property made a big difference in how I felt vs. my preliminary research. \n\nI went with a small/medium firm and they were fantastic. 8% monthly fee and $500 flat for a tenant change. It's likely that is SUPER low compared to MA. But that smaller firm got bought by a larger regional company and its gone downhill since. Random charges to my account for BS (check processing fee), and they ALSO charge tenants to pay online on top of the monthly fee they draw from my end. That just feels wrong to me. \n\nMake sure you know and understand their renter portal, how they process payments, and how/when YOU get paid. Most places I spoke to had a 5-10 day turn around, and I typically have my $$ by the 14th. Something to keep in mind- that you'll probably have to pay the mortgage before you collect the rent. \n\nIF my property were closer, I'd absolutely manage my property myself. 8% of my annual rent is a decent chuck of money that I give to the management company. Ask yourself how that cost of using a management company relates to how much you would pay yourself to do the work. Chances are good that you are either a) handy or b) have good working relationships with contractors if something goes wrong. That's half the work. The other half is tenant management, and there is TONS of good information online about managing your own tenants, running background checks, etc. if you already have a tenant, you're HALF DONE renting your property out. Why give up now?? Lol. I'm just saying don't short change your abilities in managing your own property, if it is a nice place in a nice area, chances are in your favor that managing it yourself could save you money and not be as much of a headache as you think.\n\nAnyhow, if you're set on using a management company, do some research. See what tenants think on Google, yelp, etc. \n\nAlso, if you're planning on buying another home and keeping multiple renters in your existing property, you may want to investigate the benefits and protections of forming an LLC for your rentals. By separating that property into the LLC you can further isolate your personal assets/property from any sort of bullshit tenant lawsuits, and there are some tax benefits of being an LLC too. I'm not a lawyer, but I have a few friends that own multiple properties and they all went LLC, and wished they had done so earlier.

Freeman is going to win because he is a (landlord | slumlord | provider of affordable housing) with a shit-ton of money. We have the best government money can buy.\n\nBarry is the choice of the current leadership, and is the runner-up. \n\nGentry is the candidate of parts of Nashville that otherwise get forgotten. He lives in Kings Lane. He makes statements about extending the gains made downtown to the rest of the county. But I don't think he'll win since he's also African American, and people around here still vote based on race.\n\nFox is the most interesting of the bunch. He's a free-marketeer, disassemble-government services guy who advocates most especially for ending public education through expanding charters. He emphasizes infrastructure improvement and transit. Though I like the mention of infrastructure, he's actually the only one that I'd actually vote _against_: his anti-tax, anti-government, pro-privatization, anti-government-services, lock-em up rhetoric rubs me the wrong way.  I have heard rumors he's received funding from the Koch brothers, and I don't want my local government bought that way.\n\nKane is primarily a charter school advocate. I won't vote for him because I don't believe that charters are good for the public school system.\n\n~~Bone is a pro-business, let's-apply-metrics-to-government guy who would run as a Republican if it were a partisan race.~~ Edit: not really true. He does talk about metrics, measuring government outcomes, and the importance of balancing the budget/not going into debt.\n\n\nThe front runners are all part of the commerce and growth coalition that usually runs cities-- pretty much the same bag as the incumbent.\n\nFox is the only one who has a chance of really making Nashville government something I would hate. I like services, and am happy to pay for them. Crime is decreasing in the city now as it has been for years. His desire for lower taxes and for private schools (\"for everyone\"--&gt;not just students from struggling schools, but also people from rich neighborhoods) supported with public money just shows how in his little Belle Meade bubble he is.
