Here's what happened:\n&gt; It was Sunday at Austin Wizard World Con. I had the flu, and almost missed this photo session. Though I had a fever and no cowbell, I sat there and smiled for everyone as best as I could, grateful that I'd spent the entire night throwing up so there was nothing left in me to vomit all over the fans like I was cosplaying from the Exorcist.\n&gt; The way this sort of photo session works is pretty standard: people come in, stand next to Patrick, say a few words, and then we all pose for the picture. Each person is there for less than half a minute (which I think really sucks because of how much they pay for the opportunity, but is pretty much the only way we can manage the hundreds of people who usually sign up for these things.)\n&gt; About 30 minutes or so into this particular session, these two people came in. The girl went to stand between Patrick and Frakes, and the guy directed her to stand in the front, instead. All of us tried to figure out what was going on (usually it's small kids who come to the front, usually sitting on Brent's lap or Gates' lap), and the guy said, \"I really love Star Trek, but I love [her name] even more.\" He got down on one knee, and proposed to her.\n&gt; Marina started to cry, I felt like I was going to cry, and we all applauded and celebrated when she said \"yes.\" Apparently, they'd met Marina earlier in the day, and Marina had given him shit for not marrying her, so Marina was embarrassed about that.\n&gt; I'm not sure why this picture is being circulated online, like Patrick is giving the literal Picard Facepalm, because that's just not what happened. We were all delighted for this young couple, and I know that I was honoured to be part of this moment in their lives. I think it's likely that Patrick was just wiping sweat off his brow or something like that.\n&gt; It wasn't awkward, other than that moment when everyone except the guy had no idea what was going on. Once we knew what was happening, it was awesome. I'm incredibly happy for these people, and I love that I got to be part of what is hopefully a moment they'll celebrate and remember for the rest of their lives.",

I also told this story a while back in a different thread.\n\nI have been a permanent substitute for over 3 years in a school of about 2,000 students. One day I was subbing for a construction class. It was the week before midterms so the students were supposed to just be reviewing their textbooks and preparing for the written test. Keep in mind that this class contained only senior boys and when the class settled down, I was basically inhaling sexually frustrated hormones.\nThey obviously were having a hard time staying in their seats and studying and I was having a hard time getting them to behave. As I was trying to keep the peace, I failed to notice that one boy was trying to tie his buddy's shoelaces together. Once the kid realized that this was happening, he blew a gasket and flipped his desk onto the kid who was pulling the prank. The desk landed on his forehead, causing him to bleed pretty badly. Once the kid noticed the blood, he attacked the kid who flipped the desk. I got into the middle of the fight (which I am not supposed to do) and with the assistance of another student we broke up the fight. As I sent the bleeding kid to the nurse with another student, I kept the desk flipper in the room with me. BUT as the bleeding kid was leaving the room he all of the sudden grabbed one of those metal dust pans from the construction area and completely tomahawked it at the desk flipper. It created a gash that started no less than a centimeter from the bottom of his right eye all the way down to his jaw. He was GUSHING blood and lost two of his teeth. Of course I went into panic mode and of course the fucking phones didn't work. I ran to the nearest office and was shouting for 911 and nurses and administrators to come to the room. The desk flipper lost A LOT of blood. When he was rushed to the hospital, it looked like there was a homicide in my classroom. It took the custodians about a gallon of bleach to clean the whole mess up.\ntl;dr - Metal dust pan to the face. Two kids sent to the hospital.",

I studied in the morning and there were more than 2.000 kids/teenagers in the school at the same time. The school was really big, but not that big. I notice what happens if you people together: A lot, mainly bad things. Guys use to fight everyday. It was a war.\n\nBut the actual disturbing thing was the girls. They were victims of everything and nobody seemed to give a shit.\n\nFrom my class, while we were studying, 15 girls got pregnant in the course of a year. 1 of them was caught having sex on a classroom that they thought it wasn't being used. They weren't caught by a principal or janitor, they were caught by an entire class, that then proceed to tell it to everyone and show pictures and stuff like that. It was a nightmare. Everyday there would be someone that would be victim of some sort of abuse.\n\nIt was so bad that bullying with aggression wasn't considered even the worse. If you got beaten up, people would forget really fast. The problem was the constant system of shaming. There was always a reason to put someone in the spot light and make fun of that person. The girls usually would get the worst. It as out of control. \n\nIn my last 2 years, 5 girls attempted suicide and one of them succeed - inside the school, I don't even know how many tried outside.\n\nThis one that succeed had the worst experience I could think of. There is a lot of speculation about what happened between her and some other two girls, but the ones that were proven was that she had said something in class for two other girls. These two girls were friends with a group of guys, including one that she liked, that started to \"seduce\" her, I think. He convinced her to go with him to the bathroom of the last floor - usually nobody would be there. Then, after filming both of them having sex - which for a time you could find on porn web sites -, they called the guy out and locked her in, without her clothes. \n\nThink it's bad? Here is the thing, they did this in the last day of class of that week. The other week there would only be classes in the second day. So that girl spent 3 days locked inside of a cold bathroom without her clothes. When someone found her, she was so in shock, they had to take to the hospital. In the next week, someone linked for everyone in school the  her video. Sometime after going back to the same school - I don't even know how someone can let this happen -, she jumped from the top of the building, which was enough to kill her. Yes, I saw it. She did it in the first day she got back.\n\n\nEdit: Additional info: The school was a CIEP, which was a type of public school create for the suburbs of Rio de Janeiro in the 80s. The government used it more to pretend that they care about those kids. [This is what it looked inside](http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/3/14/1363280399037/CIEP1.jpg), [this is outside](http://observatoriodasmetropoles.net/obs/images/materias/ciep_175_28_03_09%20004.jpg), [the place where most kids would be to smoke and you know...](https://ciep244.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/s50300112.jpg), [another one](http://www.jornaldaregiao.com/noticias/1231_pgina%2010%20-%20ciep.jpg), [and another](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-qK811aXL9WA/Uv5ZNs6vWgI/AAAAAAAAC-U/gcfflqplwOY/s1600/CIEP+Anchieta.jpg). Those pictures are actually of the clean ones and they are more recent than the time I studied there.\n\nI can't find a picture of mine that shows it how it was at that time. The building is something else now anyway. At the time kids couldn't take cellphones in and even so, it was the beginning of the 2000s, cellphones weren't allowed inside and they weren't that great anyway. And most CIEPs nowadays are different since the government created a law that they couldn't accept more kids than their normal capacity - which is around 600 kids. This is a [chart](https://sepereg3.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/charge-latuff-wesley-rodrigues-de-andrade-morto-a-bala-ciep-rubens-gomes.jpg) from a blog that talks about how things were bad. They are not as bad now and the one I studied in was an extreme case, because it was big and crowded. \n\nStill, at the time, we all felt like it was a prison. ",

The place was basically a dumping ground for bad rich kids.\n\n\nA girl gave 4 guys HPV. \n\nAnother girl had a 3 way (with two dudes) in the campus \"Spiritual center\".\n\nFour kids got high, stole a car and crashed it. \n\nTwo guys threw a blanket over someone and beat the shit out of them for no reason. \n\nAbout 30 people in total ran away. It was so common that the school had a term for it. OTR: On the Road.\n\nA group of six kids from the same state got together and had an orgy during one of the school breaks.\n\nSeveral kids were committed to psych wards for cutting. \n\nA kid was committed to a psych ward because he went off his meds and had a schizophrenic freak out. The cops, straight jacket etc.\n\nThree female students were raped (that I know of). Two by faculty and one by another student. All were covered up. \n\nA parent confessed to murdering one their new born children twenty years prior.\n\nThe greatest run away story was a girl who made it from the school in New England to her house in San Francisco in less than seven hours. When the school called her parents to report her missing she answered the phone. From what I heard her dad was former Mossad (some sort of Israeli intelligence or special forces), so I guess she picked up some of his tricks. \n\nEdit onto the girl running away story: She spent weeks setting it up. She began complaining about something physically hurting, her neck or something like that. When it didn't abate for several weeks they made a doctors appointment for her. During the normal week they take a head count several times a day to make sure everyone is where they're supposed to be. On the weekend the schedule is much freer. Saturday only has a couple of activities scheduled. Theater in the morning, lunch, sports in the afternoon and then dinner. She made sure they made it on a Saturday. She went to breakfast (~8:30am) to make sure they had her counted as being present that morning. What the school didn't know is that she had called the doctor as a nurse from the school and cancelled the appointment the day before. She took her taxi to the doctors office then had called a limo to take her to the airport. She had the schedule down perfectly. She stepped out of the limo and the plane took off ~45 minutes later. A short hop to Boston where she immediately hopped on a plane for SFO that took off less than an hour later. By about 3pm the school had realized something was up. They spent another three hours searching the campus and calling the doctor to try and find her. Once they determined that she had split they called her parents. It's about 6 - 6:30pm by this point. When the dean of students called she saw the caller ID and answered the phone. Holy shit was he pissed. It should be noted that her parents sent her back a few months later. She didn't even get in trouble. I think the school was so impressed/ embarrassed they just decided to sweep it under the rug like everything else. \n\nMore stories about drugs and sex than I can remember. \n\nEdit: The murder thing was never pursued because there was no hard proof of her admitting it and they were loaded. \n\nI keep adding stuff as I remember it.\n\nEdit 2: We had a Kennedy and a kid whose dad was a former member of a significant organized crime ring in Boston.\n\nEdit 3: One guy had an ongoing consensual sexual relationship with his sister. We called him \"sister fister\" because he had a herpes outbreak on his fingers one time. This one was not well known. He told me because he was under the impression we were friends. Somehow someone else found out and told a bunch of people. \n\nEdit 4: A graduate from a previous year sent one of the current students a giant dildo in a care package. The student just threw it in a dumpster but two guys with flashlights went and dug it out and chased people around campus slapping them with it. \n\nEdit 5: One guy would steal peoples electronics, mainly graphing calculators but a few cameras, and sell them on ebay. He would use the postage machine in schools mail room to have the school pay for the shipping then just leave the package in the outgoing mail. He was never caught. ",

I remember being fascinated by my friends newfound obsession with boys and feeling silently concerned that I couldn’t relate. I suppressed this.\n\nA month before I turned sixteen a gorgeous, kind and popular older boy asked me out and I said yes. Honestly I just thought it was what I was supposed to do and couldn't find a reason why I should say no. Being a teenager is weird. \n\nWe dated all through high school and he was my best friend. He was also a virgin and very respectful, so he went along with my asexual demeanor. We rarely made out or showed affection, and I made him wait 2.5 years until I got drunk enough to offer sex. He was the perfect boyfriend, and in hindsight I feel sad for both of us that my first time was something I had to talk myself into. I remember spending many nights crying in my bed at 17 and wondering what was wrong with me. I felt guilty for not wanting him. \n\nI ended things with him before I went to college, moved into the dorms and got involved on campus. I was distracted by my new freedom but gradually realized how sexually fueled the college experience is. Everyone was hooking up. I met tons of great guys that most girls would kill for the chance with, but I couldn’t make myself care. I tried so hard. I went on dates, I responded to the texts, and when I got drunk I would occasionally allow sexual advances. I slept with 3 guys and felt nothing. I felt empty and worried.\n\nThen, the night before my 20th birthday I met a girl and my world was flipped upside down. I fell in love so hard. The butterflies you get when you think about someone you like, the obsessive thoughts, relating to song lyrics... all the stuff that most people experience for the first time at age 13. The sex… it was mind blowing. It’s all I wanted to do. I was hooked. 5 years later, I’ve had 3 serious girlfriends and many casual flings. I’m extremely sexual. \n\nIn hindsight I know there were a lot of factors that contributed to how long it took for me to understand my own sexuality. I never wanted to be gay, and it took a few more years until I could make peace with it. I’m from a conservative area, and I’m so girly that people always just assumed I was straight. I didn’t want to disappoint my parents and I didn’t want it to define me. I was scared to death.

I made the decision to sleep with those women because I wanted to at the time, and I made those choices. I made the choices because I thought they were appropriate at the time. I don't like sleeping with someone I don't have an interest in dating in some capacity, so I've never slept with someone with the intention of a one night stand. \n\nWhat I HAVE found to be much more difficult is when it IS important to another partner.  When they've only had a few and I've had so many. It makes me feel ashamed. I don't want to be, but I remember having that conversation with my ex. That she'd only had 5 including me and she was my 27th. I cried. Probably one of only a couple times last year I cried. But I stood by what I said. They were important to me at the time, and I made the choice that I did. I won't regret that retroactively, even if some of those choices could have been better ones looking back at them. Personally, if someone's clean, I don't mind how many partners they've had. I think that's how you get better at sex, by having a lot of it. I've gotten much better as a partner because of it, so I won't begrudge someone else that. \n\nI'm 24, and I've been trying to slow down more.  You can really have sex and cuddle with anyone, and it'll generally feel good, at least for a time.  But finding someone who makes YOU better? Who challenges you and makes you want to be someone better?  That's hard to find. Someone you enjoy just the company of, and can really relax around, that you want to show off and be close with? And you do the same for them? That's extraordinarily hard to find. Honestly I don't actually date much because I don't find that often.  Maybe I'm picky, or a jackass, (I've heard both). But I find that I actually want to avoid sex with some girls just because it no longer feels like I get to experience dating them.  We have sex and then it all becomes like big foreplay to sex, I don't get to date them and discover my own feelings, because they like me enough that I feel bad that I can't reciprocate yet. The sex makes it worse, because they'll look to that as a confirmation of my feelings, or to show that we've got chemistry and work well together. \n\nI suppose TL:DR-Yeah, I've had a lot of partners, no I don't regret it, but yes: there are some partners that won't care your number, but you are going to feel ashamed when you've had a lot and its something of importance to your partner.  Eventually you also get to the point where the sex doesn't matter as much to you. ",

I was in a relationship with the majority of women I've slept with, some only lasted weeks, some lasted years.\n\nFrom my own observations, the more attractive a woman is, the worse she is in bed, and less open to trying new things, or adjusting her routines to better suit my needs.  \n\nAttractive people are used to having the world come to them, they have the attitude that people should go out of their way to accommodate them and their needs, and that perspective often carries over to the bedroom.  They tend to be more selfish lovers, and less generous in bed.  \n\nLess attractive or moderately attractive women perform better sexually.  The are more enthusiastic, easier to communicate with about the subject, and more willing to adjust their actions to maximize pleasure in the bedroom. \n\nAs with most data points, there have been outliars, people who buck the trend, i.e. the attractive girl who was great in bed (damn I should have married her) and the occasional less attractive girl who was horrible and unwilling to change (why did I stay in that relationship for so long?)  but in general for the spectrum of women I've encountered the above generalizations hold true. \n\nMy takeaways from being with a variety of partners, is that everyone has their own standards, rules, and kinks.  Figuring out what my partner's perversions, along with explaining my own desires plays a huge role in relationships, and can be an indicator of its potential success/failure.\n\nI don't regret it.  All those experiences made me who I am.  I learned a lot about how to control my own body, and specific things that can be done to please others\n",

Lots of one night stands or casual relationships.  I didn't tie any emotional value to sex. I did it because  being desired made me feel powerful and attractive, for curiosity, and because I was trying to find someone to make me orgasm. I had a nomadic lifestyle and it was easy to meet people and then to leave them.\n\nMy main regret is that I slept with a friend with whom I was in the early stages of 'hanging out'. For me, it was just sex and had nothing to do with commitment. For him, it carried a lot more weight. The sex wasn't good. We didn't continue dating and didn't go back to being friends. I was surprised to learn simply having sex can ruin a nice friendship.\n\nOther than that, I don't regret any of them. Some were great, some were horrible, but I learned something from each experience. I slowed down my sleeping around after a few years and had more 'normal' dating habits. Have been in a serious relationship for several years now and realized that a lot of sexual pleasure stems from emotional connection and having someone that knows you well/knowing your own body well.\n\nI think that there is no right or wrong number, nothing wrong with sleeping with lots of partners as long as no one's getting hurt, nothing wrong with being a virgin. To each their own.\n\n",

We had other partners in that space of time, but throughout we always kept in touch, worked together and eventually it became something different.  At some point I realised that she was the only person I had ever met that I could see my whole life with - the future - all laid out in front of me.  I know her so well that I could see what we would fight about, I could see the boring days, the times apart.  I could see the happy times and our children. \n\nBut we live in different countries.  Things were difficult.  We are both working on doctorates at different universities.  There is a lot of work and financial pressure for both of us.  I wanted to try to make it work out anyway - flying to see her whenever possible.  She decided it was impossible.  Obviously she didn't see in me what I saw in her.  The last time I saw her, leaving her house in the morning to catch a flight home, I kissed her and said 'I will miss you.'  And I do.  Every minute of every day.\n\nWe're still friends.  We still talk a lot.  I still try to help support her in achieving her personal dreams and goals.  I can't not.  But I keep my feelings to myself.  I started dating again (I fucking hate dating - it's such a crapshoot and so much pointless effort.)  Really, though, life is kind of hollow.  Maybe it will pass.  Maybe I'm not meant to have that life, that family.  Maybe I'm just supposed to be that weird old uncle who still dates a lot but never settles, travels but never finds home.  Who knows.

I work, I come home, do my hobbies, take care of chores and pets... same as anyone else. 99% of my life is no different than if I was in a relationship.  \n\nHowever, there are a few differences:  \n- People, when they ask if I'm in a relationship, sometimes make the situation a bit awkward with their responses. It's not awkward for me but they seem to get a bit uncomfortable when I tell them I'm alone.  \n- I do from time to time miss having someone around to share things with. Some activities I'd have done when I was in a relationship just feel hollow doing alone. I notice since I've been single that I spend much more time at home than I did in a relationship.  \n- The biggest problem I have is dealing with children. I used to tutor children; I really do enjoy teaching them. Unfortunately, there is a very negative stigma against a single older male working with children. People assume because you are single, there must be something wrong with you - and if you enjoy being around children too... well, you can see where that is going. It's too bad, because I do miss that a lot.  \n- Unfortunately this 'something being wrong with you' stigma is pretty common. Multiple times when I've met someone new, either I or friends of mine get asked why I'm single. Much in the same way you'd ask a car salesman whats wrong with a used car hes selling cheap.   \n  \nI think being in a relationship instantly gives you some 'street cred' with most people since it goes to show that at least one person thinks you are O.K. enough to hang around with. And if you don't have that? Well, there must be SOMETHING wrong if you can't find *anyone* to be with you.  \n\nI'm confident that if I tried, I could get into another relationship. But I really don't want to. For one - dating is.. well, it's quite a bit of work. And I've never really learned to do it since all of my previous relationships developed naturally from friendship first. Being older now, that seems much less likely to happen given that I don't meet nearly as many people these days. If I drug myself out into the dating world and tried though, I feel I could probably nab someone.  \n\nOn top of that I've really enjoyed the freedom to do what I want, when I want and not really have to worry about a significant other. Many of my friends are either married or on their way to getting married, and it always feels like they are a bit... locked down. Scheduling things with them is harder. That's obvious I guess, but it's a bit of a relief not to have to check in is all.  \n\nWould I consider getting in a relationship if the right person came along? Sure. It's not like I've taken a vow or something. The likelyhood of just organically coming into another relationship is small, though. So I plan to be alone, but it's not set in stone.",

Love my EX and her husband.\n\nBut to the question, what's it like?\n\nIt's great. I worry about myself, and only myself. I have a nice house, an interesting job, and the ability to devote myself fully to my hobbies (theatre and music). I make my own schedule, play video games to completion if I want, write songs and am able to devote a lot of time to things that interest me.\n\nEverything in the house is where I left it. I do have a dog, who is, I am convinced, the BEST DOG EVER. \n\nThere are some downsides. I have to work to get sex, but NSA is fine for me. I have to do ALL the chores, and deal with feeding myself. It is often assumed, since I am single, that I have more availability than others for pretty much anything. \n\nSometimes I envy my partnered friends. But this passes quickly when I realize that no one is whining at me to DO something or BE different. It might have made me a little bit selfish, but probably not, I help out friends a lot. I can. I worry about dieing alone sometimes. But end we all do.\n\nWhat makes it work is to get out of the house and be responsible for making things happen. In my case this is theatre, but it can be any social situation. I meet a lot of folks, and commit to a lot of things. Too many sometimes, but it helps me to appreciate the occasional quiet evenings at home streaming something on Netflix. I can not stand the idea of becoming the kind of person who's normal evening consists of deciding what to watch on TV.  For me, it is a treat.\n\nI over-commit and am tired a lot. Conversely I think I accomplish a lot.\n\nAm I sometimes lonely?  Yep. Holidays used to be hard, especially when my kid was younger. But now, because I am lucky, we Holiday together. I have a lot of other friends, some single, others married, and we have a quite nice extend family.\n\nTL;DR Eh, not to bad...\n\n/Biggest downside, when I scream \"MAKE ME A SAMMICH\" I have to then get up and make it.

At almost 47 years old, I'm still a virgin, and the deep-rooted problems I have to face and conquer are probably too much for someone to ever accept about me. \n\nI've accepted that I am unlovable and probably incapable of loving. I understand that I will be alone the rest of my life--so much so that to protect myself, I refuse to give anyone a chance to be close to me anymore. There were a small handful of times after I turned 40 that I thought there might be someone who would be as able and willing to deal with me as I was with her. But they never worked out, and in one case, I was mocked and made fun of like people might do in middle school or high school.\n\nWhatever I choose to do, or choose not to do, I can guarantee that it is the wrong thing to do, to feel, to think, to want, or to try, or it wasn't enough, or it was too little, too late. All so-called \"successes\" merely lead to a bigger failure later. And I frankly can't deal with it much longer.

During a year spent driving tractor trailers across the country, I learned that I am the source of all my problems.  It was always me keeping me single and miserable.  I was a very shitty person.  \n\nRealizing that, I changed my attitude.  I stopped blaming others for my personal flaws and I own my misery.  After some deep, solitary soul searching on the ice-choked highways of the nation last winter, I came back home to care for my sick mother.  I have decided that the experiential payload of my fucked-up life is more than I would ever dare to inflict on another person.  I am so completely ill-equipped to be in any sort of intimate relationship.  I have a couple of good friends, a family I love deeply and plenty of acquaintances and work associates I appreciate.  It is enough for me.  I am now happily single and plan on staying that way. \n\nI own my own home and have my mother living with me.  I have a simple, humble job driving school buses and I'm a volunteer firefighter.  I like to camp with my brother and his kids.  Just bought a kayak.  This summer I'm taking my mother to fill a bit of her bucket list.  Acadia National Park, here we come.  ",

            "text": "Edit: TL;DR: Finally the woman I've always wanted to be, too late to share it with someone.\n\nFunny thing happens the longer you live. Irony, as an unavoidable aspect of your life, reveals itself more and more often. I never really had patience for irony; I never gave it any credit. But at this point in my life it has proven itself persistent and inescapable. I’ve found myself shaking my head and surrendering to irony’s omnipresence; like death and taxes, I’m not immune.\n\nI’m 49 years old. Single, female. I have no children because I knew I wasn’t cut out for that. But aside from that, I think my experience of being a woman at the turn of 21st-century America is probably pretty representative. From preteen to just a few years ago my priorities for life have been: Be able to support myself, Be in a healthy partnership, Be healthy, Be happy, Give something back to the world.\n\nI’ve done very well except when it comes to “be in a healthy relationship.” I find myself baffled by whatever reasons can be put forth as to why this eludes me. So I’ve given up on trying to find explanations and I’ve surrendered; “que sera, sera.” Four out of five ain’t bad. But getting to this point has been epic. Because before you are driven to the point of giving up on a treasured goal, you first have to work very hard towards trying to achieve it.\n\nFirst, when you are young; pubescent, you think, “All I have to do is be pretty and sweet.” But then there are those couple of decades of wondering if you are pretty, if you are pretty enough, figuring out how to make sure you are, making sure you are, and agonizing over when you think you aren’t. This is when you obsess over the details, weight being huge (no pun…) because you can control that one. Straight teeth, nice skin, cheekbones… not so much.\n\nSweetness, one would think, would be no problem. But au contraire... Because “sweetness” includes “charming” and to be that you have to be outgoing, talkative, funny and confident. Not something easily come-by for the introverted. So then there are those couple of decades of wondering… But sweetness often falls by the wayside anyway. Some girls give it up early, simply because of the extreme competitiveness of other girls. It’s cutthroat out there. If that doesn’t happen some women end up giving it up later, sometime in their late-thirties, after a failed relationship or marriage or two or three, they discover sweetness just tends to get you run over.\n\nNot to say we all end up bitter. With enough life experience you get to the point where you know yourself. And so you know how to communicate your wants and needs. You know how to listen and hear the wants and needs of others. You’ve learned how to compromise, how to let people be who they are. You’ve learned that no one person can meet all your needs and that if you don’t love yourself you will never be satisfied with the love someone else has for you. But you also find that you can’t fit yourself into a partnership where you can’t fully be who you are. You don’t worry about what other people think about you, because you know you are a good person with good intentions and that you always do your best. You take really good care of yourself and do the things you enjoy doing. You stop waiting for someone else to do the things you love with you. You find yourself happy.\n\nUntil my mid-forties I never felt like I was pretty. But with age comes perspective and looking back at photos I was prettier than I knew and not at all overweight as I thought. True though, I was a very late bloomer in developing enough confidence to be charming. So here I am. Forty-nine and super-athletic; healthier than I’ve ever been, more in shape than I’ve ever been and really happy with my body and the way I look. I finally think I look pretty. I have the confidence to take risks to say funny things and can come off as charming if I’m so inclined. I know the importance of always responding to others with kindness and patience. I’ve never been happier with my life. I have all the things that a person needs for a healthy partnership. And boy oh boy, do I have sex drive!\n\nWhat I lack though is opportunity. I don’t get much exposure in my job and I’m not the bar-hoping type, especially given my introverted tendencies (despite my relatively recently acquired ability to be charming). Online dating worked well for exposure only until I turned 45. I suspect that, at least for women, 45 is our online “expiration date,” after which your profile gets very little traffic. Those who are taking the time to look at you tend to be in the 57 to 65 or so age range, the ones who have come to realize that much younger woman are not interested in them anymore. So they find themselves “scraping the bottom of the barrel,” so to speak. But truly, I’m sorry guys, when it comes down to it I need someone who can keep up, and whose mode of interaction is not based on the gender clichés of a former generation… Apparently, I’m not the only demographic suffering irony.\n\nSo rather than lurking in the shadows as some potential in someone else’s dramatic life event, irony has demonstrated it’s fortitude in my life, and it is very, very personal. I’m finally who I have always wanted to be. I’ve achieved the ideal me, but alas, it seems to be too late to actually share it with someone. I will take heart in my victories for now, four out of five ain’t bad. Irony may have won the battle, it remains to be seen which of us will win the war.\n\nEdit: I posted this a few weeks ago on 2x but it didn't get much traction.

I had a friend a few years ago pass away at the hand of a drunk driver and my dad has had 2 DUIs which have had a crazy negative effect on his life. Luckily I live in the downtown area of a city so I can walk to bars when I want to go out and have a few drinks and not have to drive. So a few weeks ago my friend had called me to meet me at a bar about a 15 minute drive from my apartment, I thought to myself well I'll just have 1 or 2 I'll be good to drive back. Well about 10 drinks later I decided it would be a good idea to drive home. What scares me is I didn't even think about it, I didn't even think it to be a bad idea. Even after a friend offered me a ride and a complete stranger said they would take me home, I declined and said I was fine. I don't remember much from the drive home, but what does stick out in my head is getting off of my exit ( which is a big long gradual turn ) and realizing \"wow, I think I'm going way to fast\" then BOOM I smash into the guardrail and my car immediately shuts off. Still very intoxicated my car is sitting right up next to the guardrail, I pop then hood and see if I can figure out the problem as my car will not start up again. As I'm looking around under the hood I realize \"it's 2:00 am and my car is sitting up against a guardrail, if a cop sees me I'm going to get arrested and get a DUI\" I shut the hood and RUN all the way home. I don't remember crawling into bed but unfortunately I remember waking up at 6:00 am covered in vomit. I quickly chNge and run back to the scene of the crime and my car is no longer there. I call the police dept and I told them my car broke down and I had to leave it. I was given the address of the tow yard that had my vehicle, going to pick it up was the absolutely worst part because after I hit the guard rail it was so dark out that I didn't even see the damage to my jeep so when I got there I was expecting the worst I thought it might be totaled. Luckily my aftermarket bumper protects the from corners of my car and I was left with a bent bumper and bent rim. I paid $160 dollars to get my car from the tow yard. It was weird because even though I cost me a good amount of money to fix my car I felt very lucky because I remember almost nothing from the drive home and I keep thinking about all the ways it could have went differently. I could have killed someone and not even remembered doing it. I could have been sitting in jail for the next 25 years over a.

It even looked good; people kept mistaking it for a Mazda Miata!\n\nBut the engine was (I swear to god, look it up if you don't believe me) a transverse-mounted 1000cc inline 3 cylinder motorcycle engine. Which meant that it couldn't accelerate uphill if I had a passenger. But the more important detail to \"why did I walk away from it, dead, on the side of the road?\" is this:\n\nIt had an aluminum engine block. And steel headers.\n\nWhich meant that every time you started it up, and every time you shut it off, the difference in the rate of expansion and contraction meant that the headers were prying at that engine block. Virtually every Geo Metro engine shattered somewhere around 60k miles.\n\nAnd when it happened to me, I was midway between two towns in rural nowhere. And I was out of work, which meant that I couldn't even afford to tow it to a mechanic, let alone replace the engine. So I hitch-hiked most of the way home, got a friend to come and get me, then called the bank and told them where to find it, and let them come trailer it to auction and sell it.

And I'm in on a saturday at work and have a perfect story for this post: \n\nIt all started in 2006 with my friend Brad ( named changed) and I just finished our summer jobs between university years.  We sold fireworld as illegal immigrants in Florida ( we are Canadian), and then wound up finding a job in the middle of now where Alberta, Canada, on a construction site, about 1600 km's away from our school. ( 1000 miles).   \n\nWe looked up flights and they were $500 each one way to Vancouver British Columbia, where our school was.  We saw a car add for $450. It was a 1986 oldsmobile cutlas from Saskatchewan.  The next province over to us. \n\n(Translator: British Columbia is to Alberta is what Washington is to Montana, Alberta to Saskatchewan is what Montana is to North Dakota.) \n\nSchool was starting easy math, $450 is less money and we would still have a car for school too. We hadn't found a place to live yet either. \n\nNaturally we hitchhiked in 1 day 600km's east to pick up this car.  Got a 1 day insurance to drive it back to Alberta where our stuff was and then head back to Vancouver. \n\nMade it back to Alberta, we thought we had won the lottery with this car.  I don't recall how we got this, but we had two  10'' sub wooofers in a box with an amp etc.  ( We are white canadians with no linkage to rap music whatsoever, but just spent the summer in orlando and now thought since we actually saw real black gangster and rappers, we had a legit case to pump it wherever we went. So we did) \n\nNow departing from Alberta to Vancouver our faithful car, had to be registered and insured because our 1 day insurance was up.  We need to be back to school by monday, it was friday. \nDrove the car to the DMV and tried to register it, found out that it need a new inspection because it was over 10 years old and need to have about $3000 of repairs to make it \"road worthy\".   Well shit. \n\nWe came up with a plan that since the car was 86 and the year was 06,  we could just write 06 and the car wouldn't need an inspection, or the $3000.  \n\nSo we went to the DMV across town, and planned out which DMV teller we would have the best chance of manipulating was. Of course the 28-35 year old women who looked like honey boo boo's mom.  We roll up and lay it on think flirting and talking about her cat, and how cute her new sktechers shoes that help we back were.  And sure enough,  she didn't realize the messy 06 was an 86 and we were registered and insured ! \n\nPack the car,  start driving and find out that 1. if we shut the car off it needs a jump start to run again,  2.  If we come to a complete stop the transmission stops shifting and we wont be able to start rolling again.  ( intersections, stopping for food, and we had enough gas to get us all the way once we found these quirks out. ) \n\nBy now the 3 of us had a polyamorous relationship.  Brad and I love it, and it loved us back. \n\nMake it to Vancouver, Find a place to live, and start commuting back and forth to school. Something called a head gasket(?) blew  and all we knew was that we had to fill the car up with water to get to school, and by the time we got there, ( 6 kms)  it would be steaming up everywhere and out the vents. \nWe would park the car for class, then fill it up with water again to get home. \n\nThis went on for about 4 months.  Water - Overheat - Class - Water - Overheat - Home.   \n\nFunny thing was we used to pick up buds in this car all the time and take them on a rap filled, thuggin 6km ride with a steam show at the end. \n\nThe licence plate was GEM XXX and it was called GEM. \n\nAs chance had it we found a place to live right next to the campus so we moved our stuff there. This way we could walk. \n\nAnd then like the Americans in the Iraq,  we walked over to it and took everything we wanted from it and left it there to die. \n\nTo this day we don't know where or what ever became of the Gem. \n\nTL;DR  - We bought a car and left it on the side of the road.\n\nI also have pics of this road trip to fact check. \n\n\n",

The guy I bought it from was straight with me and said with good care it *might* last two years. My goal was to have it last me until I graduated highschool.\n\nFive years later...\n\nI *knew* the car was shit. I'm not dumb, I had babied this car to get it this far and when it's latest quirk manifested I took it to a local mechanic (who was later shut down by the BBB for shady dealings, so...) who told me that of the four 'pegs' (I forget the real term) holding the engine into place I was missing two of them straight-out and the third was bent and going to break. \n\nEssentially the engine was sitting lop-sided in the car. \n\nWhich went pretty far in explaining the fountain of smoke that was burning off it every time I drove, and the kind strangers who rolled down their windows at stop lights and asked me, \"Are you aware that your car is on fire?\"\n\nSee, the engine was tilted. So, the oil pan was tilted. So, the oil was burning...\n\nI was quoted a price of 2k to get it fixed, which was *way* more than the car was worth and decided to live life on the edge until it kicked the bucket. \n\nAt not-quite 300,000 miles the engine caught fire and I pulled off the road. I acknowledged that there is a difference between 'hmm, a bit smokey' and 'holy shit, was that a fireball' and called the fire department who had nothing to do that day so they sent out several engines to thoroughly douse the thing. \n\nAnd then I called my parents to pick me up, because the fire department has rules about who can ride on the trucks, apparently, and wouldn't take me back to town. \n\nPossibly the best part of this story, or at least my favorite part? I used that car as a trade-in. It didn't run, had fire *and* water damage, and I told the dealer that I could still use it for scrap metal so I expected him to give me a trade-in value. They had a deal going on that gave you double the value of your trade-in, and we agreed that the car was worth about $500 in scrap metal so I got $1,000 for my trade in value all told. \n\n*I signed away my rights to that car and made them tow it to the dealership.*",

I still paid over 1k for food of all sorts, and then alcohol, on top of venue costs and everything else.\n\nWe were lucky to have great friends that stepped up to help.  A pro photographer took some amazing photos, we had a baker friend make our cake and it was better than the places we tried...but my bride-to-be's mom HAD to be involved.  I hated her.  She made a lot of bad decisions in life and yet felt the world owed her something.  So she says she'll bring a few of her friends to help run the food and make sure we're good.  At this point I won't say no, we needed it.\n\nAbout an hour into the reception I get pulled aside by a friend telling me the food has run out.  There's no possible fucking way.  So now on my wedding day, I'm running into the kitchen asking where the food is and getting told \"it's all out there\".  I'm panicking and shaking, thinking I forgot some food, or that I had miscalculated.  My mom suggested we do toasts and champagne and she'd look for the food to see if it got misplaced.  At this point I knew something was up.  I bought 40 bottles of Asti.  There should be NO REASON we can't fill a glass for the 120 people there.  Yet, only 50 glasses are filled and \"we're out\".\n\nMy mom was smart and went to the parking lot, started checking the vehicles of the women that joined my mother-in-law to help cater.  She spotted a vehicle with a blanket covering a bunch of stuff in the back, and the door was unlocked.  Lo and behold, two full boxes of food and a majority of the alcohol was in her back seat.\n\nTo make matters worse, this is September in Texas.  It'd been out there since apparently before the ceremony, so all the cheese was melted, the fruit was hot, the alcohol was warm...absolutely ruined.\n\nCome to find after seeing security footage that my mother-in-law and two of her friends loaded all of it up into their car.  We paid for this entire wedding BY OUR SELVES and her mom just stole over 75% of the food and alcohol, and ruined it in the process.  She argued for YEARS that it was just meant as a thank you to her friends for helping.  Yes, that was the fucking excuse she used.",

The symptoms started when Jay was getting ready to go out with my husband as a last minute bachelor party. The next day at the rehearsal she was wearing white pants and had made a miraculous recovery. \n\nMore assorted petty bullshit, like pouting when she found out at the rehearsal that my sister/maid of honor would be walking down the aisle with Jay. Kay went so far as to suggest we rearrange the lineup so my husband's sister would walk with Jay instead. \n\nBut the real kicker was at the reception. Kay is afflicted with a number of unspecified allergies and medical conditions that somehow she's never been able to name anytime she's asked. So when she found out at the reception there was no room at the head table for her (wedding party only), she pouted. And then she faked an anaphylactic reaction to some of the food she'd eaten. I say faked with confidence because I give immunizations as part of my job and have undergone training to recognize symptoms of anaphylaxis. The bitch also refused an Epipen in the midst of her \"seizure\" even when it was offered to her by me, my mother-in-law (a nurse), and a Navy medic (who crashed the reception with a Marine flight crew, but that's another story).\n\nSo an ambulance came, the best man left 30 minutes into the reception, and I was overheard offering to get rid of Jay's problem by offering to smother Kay with a pillow, which apparently makes ME the bitch.

They wanted us to do an elaborate wedding even though we had to PCS to SC in the following months. Our timeline was closing in on us and we promised to try to have a proper wedding after the big move. \n\nSo we proceed to the courthouse, my sister announces the morning of the wedding, even after she was made the maid of honor, that she wasn't attending. Then after hearing this,  my husband finds out his sister is also trying to bail but wants to leave her ass hate of a boyfriend in her place. I'm crying from frustration. My husband left his hat to his uniform and his social security card back in Seattle. My mother in law, who was my hairstylist for years, tells me that she doesn't want to do my hair and follows it up with \"stop crying you knew this would happen.\" My father in law chimes in, with all seriousness, and states \"you know no one will judge you if you leave now.\" The only people that made that day memorable was my estranged mother who stepped up and offered to do my makeup, my best friend that made me laugh, and my husband.\n\nWe did not follow through with a more expensive wedding.",

Don't expect everything to go perfectly and try to have a good time anyway.\"\n\nFirst, I was getting my hair and make-up done at a salon and they didn't have the flowers for my hair that I had previously ordered and paid for. No biggie, I gotta go. But they wouldn't let me go (blocking me from leaving, I know, weird) until some one walked to the flower store , bought some flowers and put them in my hair. I was running late and stressed at this point.\n\nThen, the cab took me to my parents hotel, I paid and got out of the car. Only, I didn't see the hotel, didn't speak Spanish, and didn't know where I was. I cried for a bit and wandered around until I found the hotel. Now I was running even later. The photographer was there but my make up was smudged from the crying and I was upset and starving. Luckily my brother was there and gave me some chicken and scotch.\n\nIt's tradition in Colombia for the bride to take an antique car to the wedding so there was a car waiting for me. I went to get in and it wouldn't start. My father (in his tux), the driver, and some random dudes walking by worked on the car while I stood by in my wedding dress. I had fun with it though and got some photos of me working on the engine. We got it going, I jumped in, and we headed to the wedding up the hill. Surprise, surprise, the car died again on the hill. We were extremely late at this point so nobody else drove by. I was stranded. I waited on the side of the road for a while and finally saw someone who was later than I was and he took me to the wedding (you can always count on Colombians to be late). I was stressed but nobody cared how late I was because brides are supposed to be late for their weddings!\n\nMore stuff went wrong but I took it in stride. My SIL was right and I had a lot of fun anyway. We had a beautiful wedding with flowers everywhere and we danced all night to live salsa and merengue music.\n\n\n",

Or no one really wants to start dancing, then stop to eat food, and go back to dancing. It was BBQ buffet, so it wasn't too much of a logistical nightmare (meaning no seating charts or anything).\n\nThe thing that really pissed me off was that my husband was stuck arguing with the manager of the place we got our food from for a majority of the reception. We called them 3 and 2 days out to confirm that they need to be here and ready to serve food by 6. They told us that they would be there by 5. We got done with our vows, and I asked my friend if the food was  here yet, \"No\".  So we rang them up and asked wtf, they said that their invoice said that food was to be delivered by 630. Yea, no. We told them to get their asses over here, that we were told 5 etc etc. Food arrives (late) and husband basically refused to sign the receipt, argued with the delivery guy and then with the manager. Manager tried to comp us stuff he already comp'd before this happened (beverages and plates and stuff). Called him out on that too. Husband and I didn't even get to eat together, and we weren't really able to go around as a **couple** and thank everyone for coming.\n\nWe ended up getting 15% off the order. Before the reduction, it was around $1400, so we got ~$200 back. Oh and for the invoice they were talking about, we got a copy, it fucking said deliver by 5.\n\nSo, no family drama or anything. But we are still sour about it. We still haven't eaten there since its happened. Which is a shame, their food is really good. I get that maybe we should've called the morning of the day-of to make sure. Or I should've just pulled my husband away and told the manager that he will just have to wait until the next day to deal with this since this was their fuck up.",

Or just extra cheese, light sauce, put it through the oven and add some fresh tomato and pepper. I have a lot of feelings about pizza.

The toll I worked on was on a fairly small road actually about an hour outside Las Vegas. There was a good amount of traffic but  occasionally there would be breaks where there are no cars so i could sit back and relax. It was a fairly cool night and quiet as it usually is and a small town I can always see off in the distance with its lights on it was a little after 11pm there was a break in cars so i sat back and dosed off I woke up about 30 minutes later still no cars in sight so i just sat there. I'd occasionally look down the road to see if I needed to prepare for a car but there was nothing I could see I turned back to my book of Sudoku but i was hearing something that sounded like the distance buzz of an engine i looked back out the window and still saw nothing so I went back to my book and brushed it off as a train in the distance that I couldn't quite see because there was a railway that was over the hill across the road from where I was sat.  After 2 minutes passed the engine noise wasn't gone and was actually louder than before. i looked out the window again I looked down the road and was about to go back into the booth but I saw something in the corner of my eye. The toll station had a light emitting from it and I could see the reflection of the light on a slowly approaching sedan.  The car rolled up the first thing I noticed was that the car was totally trashed as if it got into an accident really recently. As it rolls to a stop I look in and I see a fairly young man maybe early 20's with some dried liquid on his face because of the lighting I couldn't tell what it was. I asked him if everything was alright and her responded with a cold and smooth voice, \"Yes sir, just getting me and my sister home\". This unsettled me because he was alone in the car. I told him the toll and he rolled off again I watched as he drove off into the distance still with no head or tail lights. Before heading back into the booth I look down and see a pool of liquid formed where the car was sat. I figured it was just some sort of oil leaking from the car but because of the weird acts of the driver I knelt down and dipped my finger into it because the light from the booth wasn't perfect i could only see it as a dark liquid on the ground as I stood back up and put my hand into the light I could see it was red. Red like blood. I decided it would probably be best if I called the police they got their and determined that it was in fact blood and I told them that the pool formed over where the cars trunk sat when he was stopped. I gave them a description of the car and that's the last i heard of it. I still wonder whether it was that 20 or so year olds sister in the trunk of the car or what but i will always remember that night and if it was he got caught and punished.",

OP's post implies that Star Wars in 1977 used practical effects ('before the green screen') whereas the prequel trilogy uses CGI ('after the green screen'). And many people say that the prequal trilogy looks worse because it used less/none practical effects than the original trilogy. This is wrong.

So much computer animation looks cartoon-y and immediately takes you out of the illusion. Whereas models look real because they *are* real.

Go look at the special effects from *2001: A Space Odyssey* or *Star Wars,* and the stuff looks far more convincing than . . . well, this: http://whatculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/cg.jpg\n\nIt's good to see that many modern directors are taking the extra time to dispense with cheap-looking CGI and using real sets and actual special effects techniques [like Christopher Nolan in *Inception*]. It's my opinion that we'll look back at many of the CGI effects of today and cringe like when we look at B-movies from the 1950s with claymation skeletons having sword fights with Greek warriors.",

Note: risk is unchanged even if the kids of rapists were adopted/fostered. \n\nThe study suggests that genetic factors are largely responsible for the effect and that environmental factors, such as sons learning from fathers, have only a minor influence. The authors urged authorities to consider interventions for the male relatives of sexual offenders, including counselling on appropriate sexual behaviour or even offering medications designed to lower sex drive.\n\nEdit: they are already way too rapey in the Middle East, imagine of a new generation of rapists if raised in that part of the world.

His chief astronomer was assigned to begin the process whereby the Catholic Church would back away from its prior stance, that man alone was made in God’s image and thus visiting aliens should be assumed to be demons. It was not so long ago that the Catholic Church tried Galileo as a heretic for his stance that the Earth was not flat. Given his personal predilection for rigidity and autocratic edicts, Benedict was not deemed up to the task of dealing with increasing disclosure about the pending passage of Nibiru and the reality of the alien presence.\n\n&gt; &amp;nbsp; Pope Francis is a different man, on many levels. Genuinely Service-to-Other in his orientation, preaching the Golden Rule and the importance of love and empathy in all aspects of interpersonal life, it is a natural reach for Pope Francis to begin to educate the Catholic flock on doing the same for the visitors. There are many Catholic challenges that remain. Some in the church will want to baptize the visitors, or press them to accept Jesus as their savior, which is of course an absurd posture.  The absurdity of this position will only drive more Catholics from the church, a trend that has been ongoing for decades. \n\n&gt; -- [ZetaTalk Newsletter: *\"Vatican Admission\"*](http://www.zetatalk.com/newsletr/issue397.htm)",

Does it not make you uncomfortable that Snowden is residing in Moscow, the capital of an authoritarian country with very powerful intelligence services who see the US as their main adversary? How do we know that the SVR is not simply exploiting Snowden?\n\nA snippet from [the Telegraph](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1575097/Philip-Agee.html):\n\n&gt; Agee's version was that it was his Roman Catholic conscience that had persuaded him to leave the CIA, and he certainly succeeded in presenting himself as a principled critic of US intelligence. In 1978 he and a small group of his supporters began publishing the Covert Action Information Bulletin, a platform for his campaign to \"expose\" the workings of the CIA. In 1978-79 Agee published two volumes of Dirty Work, which exposed more than 2,000 covert CIA agents in western Europe and Africa as well as details about their activities.\n\n&gt; But in 1992 a high-ranking Cuban defector accused Agee of receiving up to $1 million in payments from the Cuban intelligence service; and in 1999 Vasili Mitrokhin, a former KGB librarian who had secretly copied thousands of files and then donated them to British intelligence, gave further details of his relationship with Communist agents in The Sword and the Shield, co-written with Christopher Andrew.\n\n&gt; According to Mitrokhin, Agee had directly approached the KGB with information about the CIA's work. Soviet and Cuban intelligence not only provided material for Inside the Company, Mitrokhin alleged, but had persuaded the author (codenamed Pont) to excise \"all references to CIA penetration of Latin American Communist parties\". The KGB file on the book claimed that it had been \"prepared by Service A, together with the Cubans\".\n\n&gt; Agee maintained that these charges were smears, pointing out that he could not have been a useful double agent because once he had left the agency he lost access to its secrets. But his value to the Soviets lay in his credibility with a large swathe of western opinion. Mitrokhin claimed that the Covert Action Information Bulletin was founded on the initiative of the KGB, which assembled a task force to keep the Bulletin supplied with material designed to compromise the CIA.",

I appreciate some of the new stuff in 5.0 by the way.\n\nBut, my question is, will we be seeing any support in the future for better zoning for future game mods? What I mean is, tools to dedicate areas of the table with simple scripting and/or toggled features like having a card snap to a pile. I feel some games would really benefit from the ability to program simple buttons that do stuff like \"look at zone A, deal three cards face up to zone b, and three cards face down to each hand\" or et cetera. I feel someway to plugin more automation to some games would be a big boon. Such as Dominion.\n\nAlso, I find that throwing dice can be a bit fiddly and wish I had a way to throw them into a magnetized zone or something that would keep them from rolling off the table.\n\nAt any rate, I'm still pretty new to TS, so I apologize if any of what I've suggested is already a feature, but in a fair amount of exploration, I haven't seen anything like these features yet.\n\nAnd, of course, thank you for your time! Keep up the great work you've been doing.",

I think these would add a lot to the game.\n\n1) Being able to randomize cards/tiles/etc, like in the base games. I'd love to be able to set up, say, some sort of board game with tiles that are randomized on game load, instead of having to take time to setup the board myself every time I want a fresh game. This is what happens when you try to play base Mahjong, but we don't have access to this feature. :(\n\n2) I'd love to have scripting or some other way to enable complex mechanics. I have some great ideas for games, e.g. a double-blind board game where the fog of war hides both our pieces until they meet up. Unfortunately, this would require a third player to monitor the game, and that's both tedious and not very fun. I'd love to have some sort of way to automate this.\n\nCould you let me know if these features are planned at some point in the future? If they aren't currently, should I keep my hopes up for the future? :)\n\nThanks so much and I hope to keep playing your game along with my friends for many years to come!\n\n",

I have tried to get a loan to pay off at least the settlement, but again due to my credit - it's always a no go. My wife and I rent an apartment and paid for our cars with cash and family help - so we really have no assets.

Turns out, he had switched throwing arms so the foot he stepped off with was not the initiating foot, and he turned around and threw me out at second base. I was infuriated, and until this day I feel like I was cheated.\n\nTL;DR - Played this guy in high school and he tricked me using his ambidextrousness. Still feel slighted.",

Engaging the rubber with the glove on a particular hand is considered a definitive commitment to which arm he will throw with. The batter will then choose which side of the plate he will bat from.\n\n&gt; • The pitcher must throw one pitch to the batter before any \"switch\" by either player is allowed.\n\n&gt; • After one pitch is thrown, the pitcher and batter may each change positions one time per at-bat. For example, if the pitcher changes from right-handed to left-handed and the batter then changes batter's boxes, each player must remain that way for the duration of that at-bat (unless the offensive team substitutes a pinch hitter, and then each player may again \"switch\" one time).\n\n&gt; • Any switch (by either the pitcher or the batter) must be clearly indicated to the umpire.\n\n&gt; • There will be no warm-up pitches during the change of arms.\n\n&gt; • If an injury occurs the pitcher may change arms but not use that arm again during the remainder of the game.",

This guy has more powers than French restaurants have ways to say \"your taste in wine is atrocious\". He has powers to do with every part of his body and then some. He forgets powers sometimes. He can shoot heat rays out of his eyes, frost breath from his mouth and red son radiation from his rear end. He's that sort of crazy dude. All because he absorbs solar radiation.\n\n&gt;Look at Batman. His power? The anti-power. Sure, he should be some tame, kung fu master of not much, but instead he's the hottest shit to ever shit on a plate. You got a power? He'll find your weakness and give you seizures or heart attacks. He'll light you on fire when you're sleeping or make you recharge your green lantern ring in the power outlet. Ten thousand volts of fuck you batman. That's Batman.\n\n&gt;But the fucking Flash, my god, my fucking GOD, this man has the greatest powers of all. If Superman's powers are being sucked off by twin super models and batman coming home to discover your wife is not only bisexual but has two friends she wants you to 'get in on' then the Flash is an orgy with a thousand women who also want to pay your World of Warcraft billing. And click the mouse for you. This man is just that fucking hot. They have to power him down in the comics half the time just to keep him from doing everyone else's job.\n\n&gt;Ok first off, he can travel at light speed. Mother fuck! Not only does he travel at light speed, but time slows down for him. So he feels like he's having a casual jog or reading the paper, meanwhile, his feet are moving so fast you can hear him coming from Montana while he's already gotten to Arizona. That's fucking fast. But wait! The ability to move at Light Speed just isn't fucking enough!\n\n&gt;I know! Christ this guy can punch you so many times in a second you've been hit five times in the cock and two times everywhere else. You think you're about to fight the Flash and then it hits you, for the last split second he's beaned your beanbags with more blows than you had sperm. But no, there's more!\n\n&gt;The Flash can also vibrate through walls. Now last I heard, you can not move so fast you can vibrate through walls, so what actually happens is the Flash is so fast he can pick and choose the movement of his individual molecules and move them through other solid objects, phasing through solid matter like it ain't no thing. I mean you think a guy who runs at light speed would run into shit but no, the Flash just goes right through them. To top that with a cherry and some whipped cream (which the Flash made in like a millisecond, fucker) he can selectively choose to cause objects to be \"okay\" afterwards or fucking EXPLODE. That's right. He can run through you and make you blow up by transferring kinetic energy into you. Like Jesus. It's bad enough you can't hit this guy, but he doesn't even have to punch you. Now your testicles have exploded and you're thinking you're about to hit him. Jesus? Just give it up. He's the fucking Flash.\n\n&gt;Now imagine that somehow there's someone who can get around the Flash blowing your balls up secret ninja technique. Ok. He can also control the flow of energy between objects. This power makes no sense but basically he can throw a rock at you, and you think it's going slow and then he's like WHOOHOOO WIZARDLY FLASH POWERS and bam it's going at light speed. So he can throw seven million rocks at you in a second then make them all goes different speeds thus striking your nads with seven million rocks one after the other.\n\n&gt;But wait! There's more! He can also take energy from the very power of speed and make clothes out of it. Yes. Flash makes his pants out of GOES FAST. The man is so fast he can make Flash pants that GOES FAST go right into. I don't even start to understand the physics of that but basically SPEED == REALLY TIGHT UNDERWEAR AND COOL LIGHTNING THINGIES OVER THE EAR. You would think this is the end of it but ok let's say Flash is fighting Superman and shit he's going to lose and fuck how is Superman THIS fucking strong? I don't know he must be Superman fused with Batman into some sort of guy with tons of plans on how to punch you far harder than anyone else ok to end it off the Flash can GO BACK OR FORWARD IN TIME ON COMMAND.\n\n&gt;How do you beat this dude? You're thinking you're hashing him good, laying down the beat-down, missing your balls and suddenly BAM YOUR MOM FELL DOWN THE STAIRS TWENTY YEARS AGO and there's a dent in your forehead and Superman not thunk so gud no more. Actually she didn't fall down the stairs the Flash put speed into them so they fell up her! Fuck you Flash!\n\n&gt;Oh, and lastly his greatest power is he isn't fast in bed. He takes it slow and gets all the ladies with his superpowers then actually satisfies them in the sack. Who the Hell is this guy? You'd think he could AT LEAST be a premature ejaculator since his penis is moving at light speed but NOOOO he's even good in bed.\n\n&gt;And that, ladies and gentlemen, is why Wolverine sucks cock and should go die in a freak grease fire.\n",

I barely have time to play games these days but my GF is away for a study abroad so decided I could play witcher 3 in the meantime.\n\nBut splatoon is just FUN. It's the definition of having a great fucking time. I don't care when I lose like in fighting games because im part of a team so it's ok that not everything relies on me. And I don't have to be on the face of an opponent all day, I can be around just inking the floor and shit. And I'm sometimes a squid. I don't even know if im making sense, but this game rocks.\nSometimes i just sit there and say ill play 3 rounds of splatoon and then ill change... and suddenly poof its 12:00 am and i played 3 hours.\n\nAmazing, fun, new experience.",

It looks like a new game -- but it's gameplay is CS:GO. The game features\na scopeless AWP. Weapon attachments are now purchasable items, the AWP's scope is in that list. Zeus skins will be introduced. Inventory will carry over from GO, stats won't, but in your profile people will be able to view your CS:GO rank. You can use skins in both GOU and GO.\n\nLeft 4 Dead 3, previously leaked earlier, will be revealed as a trailer. A hand rises from the bottom of the screen on a black background. Country music begins to play, and the hand begins to decay stop-motion style until only three fingers remain. The trailer picks up in real time, the hand turns to the camera and claws at it. Cut to black. We see the mark the hand left.

Reddit hates McCarthy but I really think she's a good comedic actress and her performance in Spy is another proof of that.\n\nI have to admit that while Statham delivers a hilarious performance, I also found his character (as well as Aldo) almost hopelessly irritating which I guess was kind of the point.  McCarthy's character is actually the most competent one in the film.\n\nI enjoyed the back-and-fourth banter between McCarthy and Byrne.\n\nIt's hard to describe the film, it's kind of a spoof and it kinda isn't.

The fact that he was all talk and never actually did anything cool or heroic at all (besides throwing the briefcase) is the funniest thing ever. Serafinowicz was fantastic too. Much better than *The Heat* (which I still enjoyed) but not quite as good as *Bridesmaids*. However, *Bridesmaids* is kind of cheating by having such a great ensemble.\n\nEDIT: Oh, and the Bond style opening credits/song were actually really awesome and subtly hilarious.",

It's too long, and I think the jokes relied too much on \"you like a (grotesque description)\". he action was surprisingly gory, but unlike say something like the Jump Street series I didn't feel any of the sequences were great or memorable. McCarthy was solid as expected, and it was nice that the joke of her character wasn't that she was a fat spy, but a great one that everyone overlooks. Jason Statham however is the real wild card (heh) of the movie, he is by far the funniest addition to the film and I don't think I've seen him do a full comedic role since Snatch. \n\nOverall, I'd give it a 6.5/10.

Period.\n\nTreasure Planet is a film where absolutely everyone - production designer, director, cinematographer, animators, writers - brought their \"A\" game. The visuals are vibrant and beautiful. The characters are interesting and generally well developed. The action is smooth and, in some cases, rivals the direction of live-action films (one sequence, a chase through the interior of a ship, stands out as an example of animation skillfully imitating a live action sequence, including the simulation of a moving, hand-held camera - something other animated films just can't match). Everything in the movie just works. \n\nThe heart of the film is Jim Hawkins' own conflicted nature and the self-doubt and self-destructive tendencies that he's been left with in the wake of being abandoned by his father. Unlike many Disney animated movies, there is real emotional weight to Jim, and the developing mentor relationship that he gains with Silver (essentially the film's villain) offers obvious parallels for those who've grown up with mixed feelings towards an absent parent. Silver works as a nuanced villain (in a Disney movie! can you believe it?!) whose own motivations are complex and who helps to both drive the conflict of the film and develop the character of Jim. Ultimately, Treasure Planet is a film with true imagination. It's a gorgeous, heartfelt adventure that just works on almost every level.\n",

Spoiler Free- The movie had a complete lack of originality regarding the jump scares, or any of the horror imagery whatsoever. There were a few startling scenes, but as another commenter wrote, you could see them coming from a mile away. The storyline was unfortunately vanilla and never actually seemed 'dark', except for one scene which was treated plainly. [Movie Spoilers](#s \"It seems to me like the story was written much darker originally, but was rearranged to fit a PG-13 rating. Namely with the demon character, who wore the breathing mask. I actually thought up until the end that the demon was Quinn's mother, who had died of lung cancer, hence the mask. The ghost was a suffering manifestation of her mother, stuck in the Further, and who heard her daughter's calls as seen in the knocking on the wall, and waving at the beginning at the movie. Honestly, the ghost of the mother said she was at the audition, as was the ghost who made contact. For what reason? Just trying to be creepy? It would've made so much sense for Quinn to take her mother's ghost for a monster.   Instead, we received a nameless, frankly boring ghost who added nothing to the story overall. It could've been a great movie if they had taken those extra steps and refined Elise's storyline. \")",

I haven't seen any of the sequels(I played through Alien:Isolation if that counts), seen Prometheus though.\n\nI have to say, I was a bit underwhelmed. Granted, the movie is 35 years old and it was probably way ahead of its time. However, I just felt kinda bored watching it. I fully appreciate its acting, directing and cinematography and I know it was probably frickin' terrifying in theatres when it first came out but the movie just feels dated to me. I'm not talking about the design of the alien or the interface of the computers - the UI is understandable and, arguably, contributes to the overall atmosphere while the alien did look pretty badass. Where the movie most feels dated to me is the sound effects. I never felt the suspense, the hopelessness of it all. Jump scares(which I usually hate, thankfully there were almost none in this one) were accompanied by music that also felt kinda cheap.\n\nAs I said earlier, the film feels boring to me, I actually lost interest a few times which i never do, I usually hardly take my eyes off the screen. I never felt the tension the main characters felt, I was pretty sure they were all dying but for Ripley's character.\n\nDid I dislike it because I'm just 18 and I'm spoiled by modern horror and sci-fi? Maybe, but I highly doubt it. I get the appeal, I usually like old space sci-fis, some horror flicks as well. Anyway, I'm interested enough to watch Aliens tonight, I've got high hopes for that one!\n\nP.S sorry for my chaotic writing, I just can't articulate well enough in English, it's not my first language.",

Everyone complains about prometheus for the dumb characters doing stupid things, which is a very valid complaint, but alien has the exact same problem. Some examples: I don't think they used their flamethrowers even once to defend themselves(why have flamethrowers if you aren't going to use them??), they kept splitting up,(every time they split up people died! How did they not figure this out and stick together?), oh and don't even get me started on the stupid cat. I don't know I feel like no one else has this complaint and it surprises me but the characters in this movie were just as stupid as the characters in prometheus. Why this movie isn't criticized in the same way is beyond me. Effects and atmosphere and all that stuff were great, especially for when it came out, but for me that does not make up for the all the characters lack of common sense. Just my opinion",

If you think you might have a hard time getting through a silent black and white film with incidental piano music, the 1984 restoration will at least give you a more modern experience to help you though the movie ( it's the version I show in school to students. and generally they really enjoy it ). If you enjoy it, go back and watch some of the more traditional or complete releases of the movie, there are plenty to choose from.\n\nIf you can find a way to enjoy the film however, the movie itself is absolutely astounding.\n\nIt's arguably birth of the modern scifi movie genre. The scope of imagination on display is phenomenal. The futuristic cityscapes, the technology, it's so ahead of its time. The detail, the awesome anachronisms (one of my favourite bits, the film predicts flying cars, except it presents them as biplanes because why would you not assume in 1927 that everyone In the future would commute to work in biplanes ?  )\n\nbut, it's all a bit like Shakespeare. It's only once you get under the movies skin and realise just how ahead of its time and how amazingly well crafted it is and how influential it has become do you begin to understand why it's such an awesome work of art.\n\nGive it a go, and give us your thoughts.

I fell asleep for a little bit in the middle ***BUT*** that was mostly because I was watching it in a warm room after a late night and a long day. It's cinema history and I really recommend you make the effort to watch it. Too many people nowadays dismiss watching older films because they see them as \"boring\".

            "text": "Edit: I forgot that she also has a facebook page with a bunch of pictures that we try and update regularly!\nhttps://www.facebook.com/RipleyToucan\n\n\nI get asked a lot for video so this time I actually put some up. Here are a few videos of her to give you an idea what it's like to have a toucan. \n\nHere she is trying to cuddle me on that same trip: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmKH_mj80Xg\n\nFalling asleep at the hotel: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOccGBASxgA\n\nAnd playing at home: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Rh6lfQc20E\n\nAlso, here is some basic information from the last time I posted!: \n\nHer name is Ripley, she is a Toco Toucan and is about 9 months old. Yes, it is completely legal to keep them but they are fairly rare in captivity and very expensive. They are almost nothing like parrots and require much more space and a special low iron diet composed of fruit (blueberries &amp; Papaya) and a low iron pellet designed for softbills. The reason for this is that they are prone to hemochromatosis (or iron storage disease) which is why I monitor what she eats as much as possible. They are extremely active and when out spend most of their time bouncing of the walls while occasionally visiting for pets or cuddles from you. They enjoy sunbathing a lot so we keep a lot of perches in windows around the house and try to take her outside as much as possible when the weather permits. They don't suffer from the problems many other birds do such as biting, feather plucking, and being generally emotional. This is speculated to be because even though they are extremely social and do rely on their flock to an extent, they have the ability to keep themselves entertained for the most part. They are also extremely intelligent and we provide her different puzzles to solve that have blueberries inside as rewards (those are her favorite), and are also in the process of potty training her and training her to recall on command. Although their bills look dangerous, they are actually extremely light weight and made of ceratin like your fingernails. They also have relatively weak biting strength and would have difficulty hurting you even if they really wanted to. Most people think it's main purpose is for reaching fruit (which is true to an extent) but it's actual use is for temperature regulation. They can expand and contract the capillaries in their bills to dump excess heat similar to how an elephant uses it's ears. Despite them being well known for eating fruit, they are also carnivorous- Eating anything from lizards, frogs, bugs- and even other birds. They also have a knack for raiding other birds nests and eating their eggs and babies straight from the nest. They have an instinct to thrash things in order to kill them which is why we provide her lots of toys that resemble small animals which she enjoys pretending to kill like a little velociraptor. It's also extremely entertaining if a moth or any other flying insect gets in the house because they make it their sole purpose to hunt, kill and eat it and rarely lose focus until they do. Another benefit they have over other birds is that they are extremely quiet. They only make 2 sounds- a soft clicking sound to express different emotions and a louder croaking sound which sounds like something straight out of Jurassic Park. The croaking sound, while louder, is nothing compared to that  of even a small parrots squack and they normally only make it when alerted or when they want to bring attention to something. They aren't really any more messy than other birds but their poop is actually much easier to clean. Unlike most birds, they lack the presence of a crop- so not only do they feed their young whole foods but their food also goes straight through them and ends up looking almost exactly how it went in which makes for easy clean up. They also have a natural instinct to catch things which can make things fun!\n\nI've been around a lot of animals and have kept birds almost my entire life and I have to say they are probably the best pet money can buy. They have all of the pros that most birds have and almost none of the cons. They are also probably the most prehistoric acting bird I have ever been around! If you have anymore questions I am happy to answer.\n\nI'll try and upload some video of her this week if there's any interest!\n\n\nHijacking this informative post for some extra pictures:\n\n[**Here are some pictures of her tongue I put on mildlyinteresting \\(it looks like a feather\\**)](http://imgur.com/a/yVZrV)\n\n[**Here is a picture of a wet toucan**](http://i.imgur.com/YuPcLtt.jpg)\n\nAnd here is what you will all probably really want to see: [**baby pictures!**](http://imgur.com/a/gMqOg)\n\n**[Here she is in the same pose at christmas with my wife](http://i.imgur.com/FvU3ynU.jpg) \n\n[And another](http://i.imgur.com/v7oJbXG.jpg)\n\n[Here are some from the same time as the OP](http://i.imgur.com/ZR7vVgR.jpg)\n\n[and another](http://i.imgur.com/xG3bhKy.jpg)\n\n[one more](http://i.imgur.com/9J6LLqc.jpg)\n\n[Here she was chilling on one of her perches the other day](http://i.imgur.com/181kqbS.jpg)\n\n[Here she is with my battlestation](http://i.imgur.com/aTg00pJ.jpg)\n\n[If he be worthy...](http://i.imgur.com/0gnRYba.jpg)\n\n[Wife holding her like a baby again](http://i.imgur.com/lClRMuU.jpg)\n\n[last one!](http://i.imgur.com/twYsiPc.jpg)\n**\n\n\n[I almost forgot that she actually has a cameo in one of our more silly YouTube videos!](https://youtu.be/uiC7EGJGjvs?t=1m37s)\n(I run a YouTube channel that our family owns.)\n\n\n\n",
