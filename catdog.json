One is an albino.\n&gt;\n&gt;* How much shedding, barking, farting and drooling can you tolerate?\n&gt;\n&gt;No problems with shedding, barking or drooling. Zero tolerance for farting. However, I will try to offer the dog the best diet possible, to minimize farting.\n&gt;\n&gt;* What size of dog are you looking for?\n&gt;\n&gt;The only preference is that it is capable of reaching high speeds, so probably one with long limbs. But no general preference.\n&gt;\n&gt;* How much grooming do you want to do, or how often can you pay a professional to groom him?\n&gt;\n&gt;I can learn and do grooming whenever necessary. I wont pay a professional.\n&gt;\n&gt;* What's your activity level? How much time a day can you give to walking and playing with the dog?\n&gt;\n&gt;Essentially endless, as my job requires me to be personally active. I.e. I can run and play with a ball with the dog every day, just as I do it alone now. \n&gt;\n&gt;* How often will the dog be left alone? If needed, could you hire someone to walk your dog when you can't be home, pay for a doggy daycare, or come home at lunch to break up the day for him?\n&gt;\n&gt;Hard to say, as my daily routine is not very consistent. I could hire someone, or ask my cousins for help. They live across the street, and are essentially me from 10 years ago.\n&gt;\n&gt;* How trainable does your dog need to be?\n&gt;\n&gt;As trainable as possible. This is a top priority. I mean, I'd get a dolphin if he had proper limbs.\n&gt;\n&gt;* Do you live in an apartment? Are there breed or size restrictions?\n&gt;\n&gt;I live in a house, no restrictions. Also have a small garden, I think thats an advantage.\n&gt;\n&gt;* Do you have a fenced yard, or is there a large fenced area nearby? \n&gt;\n&gt;~2m fence.

If it were possible to replace my boss with one of my parrots, I'd be a stress-free guy.\n&gt;\n&gt;* Where do you intend to keep your dog?\n&gt;\n&gt;Not sure what I should write here. He will be kept at home, with option to go to garden whenever necessary. He will be the man of the house, with access to all rooms and couches.\n&gt;\n&gt;* What's the weather like where you live?\n&gt;\n&gt;Pretty shit. Mostly overcast.\n&gt;\n&gt;* Have you budgeted for your new dog?\n&gt;\n&gt;First time the language is a barrier in this questionnaire :( does that mean if I have created a budget for the dog, i.e. estimated dog-related expenditures? No. But that should not be a problem. Unless they are REALLY higher in upkeep then I imagine.\n&gt;\n&gt;* What are you looking to get out of your dog? (i.e a running buddy, a lap warmer/companion, guard dog.\n&gt;\n&gt;My life consists of interactions with two species: humans and parrots. I would like to form a lasting friendship with something in-between the two. That's the main priority.

(even bigger bonus: get excited when the right team scores)\n&gt;\n&gt;\\- Form a relationship based on respect &amp; trust with my kakadus.

Only people have 'races'.\nAlso, it's great that you want to play with your future dog and learn, but don't get it based on the fact that you want it to play this specific game with you.  There are breeds that are very fast, smart, durable, and have high energy demands, but most people will not recommend them for you as a first time dog owner.  It's a cool video BECAUSE it's so uncommon.  You might be able to teach a dog to do that, but it would be especially difficult if the dog doesn't like it, and in some cases you might be able to teach it but the dog might not ever like it as much as that dog does.  It's the same with people, some people like to swim, others like to play soccer.\n\nThere is a questionnaire on the right you can fill out to help determine what kind of breed would be best for your lifestyle, I'd suggest filling that out and posting it first and then go from there to get some ideas on breeds.  Just don't go in to it with the idea that any dog would be able to learn that game and be disappointed if it can't.\n\nI don't even know how a dog would be able to do 'around the world' or what exactly a 'handstand rear keepy uppie' even is...sorry.","score":20},{"text":"check out Catahoulas","score":0},{"text":"I would recommend a standard poodle.

If you're willing to use a pair of clippers to shave the dog every 4 weeks or so, it should be no problem.  You can go with a utilitarian sport clip with the hair all shaved to the same length, or a kennel clip (which has fluffy head/ears and tail with short body/legs/etc).

They definitely take time and a lot of patience but can overcome a lot of their fears. Be quite, gentle and calm around her. If you get really angry or loud that will probably upset her. She's going to be a very sensitive dog so your corrections need to match her quiet manner. \n\nMy dog used to be so afraid of people that he would just run the other way whenever he saw someone. I saw a really good dog trainer and started taking him to dog training classes. He was quite nervous the first few times but soon settled in. It was a great place to work on actual training skills, but more importantly it was good socialization for him. He eventually got more and more comfortable with the sights and smells of other people and dogs and noises. I made sure the trainer knew how shy he was and she worked at his comfort level. One very helpful and important thing she taught me, is that he needs to learn to not run away from people every time he has a moment of fear. He doesn't need to be super social either, but he does need to learn to accept the presence of others. \n\nSo, what I worked on is this  - I would have him sit at my side when people come over. I tell them explicitly not to look at him, stare at him or pet him. All of these things make him feel very uncomfortable. Tell people to flat out ignore your dog (I warn you that a lot of people will not listen to you the first time you say this, so be firm). My dog used to run away whenever anyone was near him so I have him on a leash and calmly remind him to sit. When he does, I give him lots of treats. I let people know that we're in training and everyone is really good about it. Anyways, start with just having your dog sit at your side and reward and praise when she doesn't run away. Slowly, I would build it up to people sometimes offering their hand for him to sniff. He's now okay with this, but he's never become okay with people petting him when he doesn't know them, so I work with what I am given. \n\nIt's good now though because when people come over, I let them know he's shy and to ignore him. He doesn't run away from people anymore, but rather will come sniff them and check them out when he's ready. Usually by the end of the visit, he's pretty comfy with these new people and allows a lot of them to pet him. \n\nIn general, praise when she's being good and doing well. Liver treats were great for my boy. A lot of love, praise and gentle corrections when she's doing something you don't want her to do. As she settles in I definitely recommend finding a good trainer in your area and enrolling in some classes, it will really help get her used to sounds and sights and you can get constant feedback from the trainer.","score":39}]},{"title":"[Help] 3 month old having trouble understanding the bell to be let out.","url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/3a22m4/help_3_month_old_having_trouble_understanding_the/","permalink":"/r/dogs/comments/3a22m4/help_3_month_old_having_trouble_understanding_the/","score":3,"numComments":3,"subreddit":"dogs","comments":[{"text":"you have to get HIM to ring the bell before you open the door. right now he just thinks you're ringing the bells as part of your process of opening the door. he's not understanding that you're expecting him to ring the bells to indicate that he needs to go outside.\n\nyou also have to be patient. he's only three months old, he's still very much a baby.","score":0}]},{"title":"[Discussion] What should we bring camping with our dogs?","url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/3a12di/discussion_what_should_we_bring_camping_with_our/","permalink":"/r/dogs/comments/3a12di/discussion_what_should_we_bring_camping_with_our/","score":6,"numComments":21,"subreddit":"dogs","comments":[{"text":"Seconding the muzzle.
