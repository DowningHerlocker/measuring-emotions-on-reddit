But it's possible that your family might be unconsciously reinforcing those food-based behavior problems you see in your dad's dog, and they may end up reinforcing begging behaviors in your puppy too.\n\n\nSome dogs are more food motivated than others. Generally it's a good thing because it makes them more trainable. Begging, though, is very easy to stop. Just don't pay attention to a begging dog. Obviously don't cave and feed it, but don't scold it either. Oddly enough, scolding is another form of behavior reinforcement. Just ignore it. Don't look at it, don't make eye contact, don't address it. Eventually it will stop, but you have to be consistent. If your parents feed your puppy from the table, it will keep begging no matter how hard you try to train it not to.\n\n\nDogs won't \"pick up\" an obsession with food. Just keep mealtime consistent, and maybe feed them separately so your puppy doesn't feel like eating is a competition with Duke. \n\n\nBe careful to take note of how certain behaviors are being consciously or unconsciously reinforced by you or your family members, and also, please forget this alpha stuff. The cool, calm energy Cesar Milan talks about *is* important to help a dog feel safe and trusting, but getting a dog to respond to you is much more about consistency and rewards than dominance.

I've never heard anyone say that, but I am a huge backer of dogs needing titles outside of conformation to be worth breeding. Granted, some breeds are literally bred to just sit there and be happy, but I'm a huge believer in your dog isn't worth passing on genes if you aren't going to work it to the breed's potential.\n\nPoint 2 is iffy because yes, you should request to see both parents. If the father was sperm shipped from the other side of the country, fine. If the father is within a reasonable distance, a good breeder will definitely arrange for you to meet the father at their request. Edit: I do really agree with the notion that having both parents owned by the breeders is a good thing to question, however, there are breeders out there that have bred two different lines to achieve one very strong line, and that means uniting the two lines they have created at some point. \n\nPoint 3 is ridiculously titled. Absolutely ask to see where the puppy is raised. This can be satisfied through pictures, a webcam, or a scheduled visit when it is safe for the puppies and mother.\n\nPoint 4 I would tend not to agree with, but I have found some amazing breeders that breed multiple breeds. However, I would caution someone against going with a breeder that breeds completely different types of dogs. Most of the multi-breed breeders I found were breeding, say goldens and GSP, so they were breeding hunting dogs. I trusted them in this case.\n\nPoint 6 is just beyond ridiculous. A good breeder will only breed when they have a certain number of people dedicated to their puppies. This usually means they have 2-4, so they can at least be comfortable knowing they will not be stuck with 10 puppies. I personally am very wary of someone who will willingly breed puppies just cause, unless they actually want to have a small army of puppies in their house forever (which sounds craaaaazy). It's just all around irresponsible to breed solely for you and to not consider the puppies you are bringing into this world from your direct actions.\n\nPoint 7 is really case specific honestly. I like seeing that a breeder is involved in some type of club just because it helps me to weed out the less experienced breeders. But I can definitely understand where certain clubs have standards that are actually harmful to the breed.","score":41},{"text":"We discussed this on a different sub. This was my comment there:\n\nI don't like it. Some, maybe a fair bit is true. But there's a whole lot more to it than what she's explaining. \n\n&gt; If it’s not – if the best and most demanding test for how well you’re doing as a breeder is the sheep pen or the field trial or the performance ring – then that’s where you should be.\n\nSo here she's talking about working lines. Even working lines breeders will do a little conformation showing occasionally. And a breeder with advanced working titles is the only reason I'd let no conformation titles slide. *But* this makes it sound like buying some byb \"farm dog\" is ok because \"they're doing what they were bred for.\" And a newb wouldn't/shouldn't be buying a working lines dog, especially when you get into the Aussies or GSD type breeds. So yes, what she says here is true, but very misleading. \n\n&gt; It’s also a huge generalization to say that I should be “more than willing” to have you meet the mom dog. That depends entirely on how old the puppies are, how she’s feeling about strangers touching them, and whether she’s in shape to be seen \n\nRight, but she should still be there. Maybe crated if she doesn't do well with strangers around her puppies. I know she just had puppies. I don't care if she's scraggly and skinny. But she should be there. This is what people would use to justify meeting at the Walmart parking lot. \n\n&gt; So now, if you ask to come over, the answer is no.\n\nNope. I want to see your setup. Sorry. There's precautions you can take. With Korbin's breeder, I gave her references: Ozzy's breeder, my landlord, my vet and a friend. She had a friend over at the same time I went to her place, assuming in case I turned out to be a crazy. Again, justification to meet at walmart. \n\n&gt; And the breeders who have a second breed (or a third breed) usually do just as fantastic a job with them as they’re doing with their first breed.\n\nI don't have a problem with this, as long as it's within reason. \n\n&gt; Breeding well takes commitment and sacrifice and money and incredibly hard work, but it does NOT take some kind of educational or income level and it is not granted along with a silver spoon. Anyone willing to put in the effort deserves to try.\n\nUm no. This justifies the bybs who think they \"deserve a try.\"\n\n&gt; “Only breed when you have enough people” makes it sound like it’s a tap you can just turn on and off – oh, there’s my fourth reservation! DING! Quick, go out there and impregnate Molly!\n\nNo, there should be a waiting list with enough people on it to cover most of the expected puppies. There will likely be a couple extra puppies, but a full little available is a huge red flag. \n\n&gt; So science and I got together and agreed that we weren’t going to breed that way, which means no membership for me.\n\nOk?

Anyone else disagree with their breed's national club?\n\nI went and read the [COE](http://cardigancorgis.com/CodeOfEthics.asp) in question and I don't see what the issues are there. Maybe this part? \"No member shall breed a bitch to cause her to produce puppies more often than twice in 18 months nor breed her before 12 months of age.\" Given that it's a breed that can be dysplastic, I don't get why anyone would be breeding before 24 months...\n\nAnyway, I served on the board of mine for 6 years, so I'm clearly in the other camp.

Would I join that club? No. \n\nI think some breed clubs really do want to educate owners, and do so from a sense of stewardship of the breed. I feel that the Golden club absolutely feels this way. I'm not so sure about the Sheltie people. \n\nAs far as should we toss out everything that most of us think should be kept in mind when looking for a breeder? no. Some of what she discusses is very nuanced, and if you are a total beginner to the world of purebred dogs and breeders, it's not a good idea to go by her writings. \n\n","score":-3},{"text":"1.

I knew I wanted to use positive reinforcement so I looked for trainers who spoke to that in their descriptions. \n\nA lot of this is word of mouth and asking around for what people have experienced where. ","score":4},{"text":"What I look for in a boarding kennel, is somewhere that is insured and apart of an association of kennels (there are many country-specific ones). I like to see involvement in the dog community, for instance my kennel is involved with the local rescue scene and they also support and participate in an annual cancer walk for dogs (it supports humans, but the walk is done with the dogs).\n\nI like to talk on the phone with them about my dog, and about their kennel. I want to know about their routine, I want to know how they'll integrate my dog into their routine, and what they can handle. One big test I had was that I asked them how they would handle my dog, who when he started going was not yet neutered. They gave me a very educated response, saying that they would ensure all the staff knew he was intact and that he would not be put in play groups with dominant or intact dogs either male or female. He was at first only let out with their personal dog, who they knew was very laid back and would allow for them to gauge his interactions and what he could do with them.\n\nI also like to see good customer service, and people who are just as dedicated to my dog as I am. My kennel gives updates via facebook with photos and posts regarding what the dogs are up to, they post GoPro videos of the dogs running on their property (they have almost 40 acres of land, another selling point for me as I have a medium sized active dog). My kennel was telling me one day that they had a really busy week, a long-time client's mother had died and they had to go last minute to the funeral, and even though they were full at the time they welcomed the dog into their home as a favour to the client. That's customer service, going above and beyond for the relationship with the client. It made me want to go back, knowing if I was in a jam they would help me out.\n\nCheck the reviews. Google the kennel's name. Ask around local animal businesses. When you find a kennel you like, you stick with them, my parents have been using the same one for 12 years. If someone likes the kennel, they will leave a positive review, and most people are repeat customers if they like the place.\n\nAs for negatives, a lack of organization is a big one for me. If they don't have a solid system for booking, responding to emails, etc. then it's not for you. If they can't give you a solid schedule, and they won't allow you to drop by for a tour (at their convenience) then it's not for you. My kennel does bookings online, or in person, and I get regular email reminders about my bookings and confirmations of bookings. I like knowing that they're always on top of things.\n\nIn terms of trainers, I tend not to follow reviews as closely. Training is something that's very personal, many people are adamantly against some training philosophies, and most of their reviews tend to be very emotion-based and are not representative of what's really happening. Personally, I try to come into training with an open mind, and because of that I'm willing to try anything (or at least within reason). The trainer I use has been criticized for being brutal, too stern with young puppies, putting terribly cruel torture traps on dogs (choke collars and prong collars), the list goes on.\n\nNow that I've been there for half a year and three courses later, I can accurately say that every training method they used I tried on myself before it got to my dog. I put a choke collar on my upper arm and had my husband yank it, I put a prong collar on my upper arm and yanked it myself. I researched each one, and checked to see the reasoning behind their use, and educated myself on how to PROPERLY use these tools. I have never once seen abuse take place at my trainer's classes, I have a 9 month old hard-headed Australian Cattle Dog who is passing their classes with flying colours and has nothing but a wagging tail when he goes to training class. If I had listened to reviews, I might not have gone with them, and I might have otherwise missed what has turned out to be a great situation.\n\nMy training school has been around for several years, has trained literally thousands of dogs in their classes (they keep a tally on their website, it's kind of fun!) and has several trainers to choose from with different interests/experience levels/backgrounds. The head trainer offers a certification course for dog trainers, and many have taken it. They also train service dogs for veterans. You can always ask to watch a class, and taking a Puppy Kindergarden class with your pup can often give you a good way to experience the training school and how they work. Often you'll see dogs from classes before and after yours coming in and out, and you can judge from there what type of dogs their training produces. If you have two training schools you'd like to try, enroll pup in both kindergarden classes and ultimately go with the one you feel most at home in :)\n\nBasically, decide on what YOUR standard is. My parents don't care for updates on their dog when they're on holidays, I do. Their dog is older and doesn't need as much exercise, but exercise is important for me and my dog's needs so a big property and a variety of activities are good. My parents were happy with treat-based training at a basic obedience class and never wanted to go above puppy kindergarden, I saw dogs with high levels of training and focus, and I wanted my dog to reach that point eventually so I followed their methods and we have weekly training classes.\n\nAt the end of the day, you can always cancel a booking at a kennel and you can always quit your training class. Be cautious, but be willing to try things to see what suits your dog best.","score":47}],"sum":51,"min":4,"max":47},{"title":"[Help] Need to find a placement for my mothers dog.","url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/39x2t6/help_need_to_find_a_placement_for_my_mothers_dog/","permalink":"/r/dogs/comments/39x2t6/help_need_to_find_a_placement_for_my_mothers_dog/","score":10,"numComments":8,"subreddit":"dogs","comments":[{"text":"Start email/calling rescues in your area.

They started out once a year-6mo and then increased in frequency to where he was having them roughly every 6 weeks. I knew he would need medication but I was putting it off and putting it off and putting it off. He had two in one day last July and I decided I had to stop putting it off.\n\nI did a LOT of research before choosing to put him on something. The vet that saw him on the day he had two seizures very strongly recommended Phenobarbital, which is the most commonly prescribed drug for seizures in dogs. When his bloodwork came back and his regular vet called me to let me know he was clear to begin medication, I talked to her about options. I personally don't like phenobarbital so my vet suggested Potassium Bromide, which I liked the sound of much better. The short term side effects are pretty much the same, but the Bromide is not processed by the liver so there's no potential for long term liver damage and it's gentle on the kidneys too.\n\nHe's been on the Bromide for almost a year. He's had one seizure in that time and it seemed much more mild than the ones he had before. His personality has not changed at all, he is happy and has gotten used to taking the medication (it's a liquid so it's a little weird to give) and all in all he's doing well. \n\nBoth Potassium Bromide and Phenobarbital have sedation/lethargy as a side effect. Not all dogs get this side effect, mine did not get it at all. For the vast majority of the dogs who do get it, it is temporary - the first few weeks will be the worst while the dog is adjusting to the medication, but then the lethargy will taper off. I know a woman who started her dog on Phenobarbital and her dog turned into a zombie - she was so scared, she was wondering if she made a mistake and she couldn't stand seeing him like that, but maybe a week and a half later he kind of woke up and started returning to normal.\n\nYour dad is being ridiculous.
